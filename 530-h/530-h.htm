      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DRIVEN FROM HOME.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A boy of sixteen, with a small gripsack in his hand, trudged along the
      country road. He was of good height for his age, strongly built, and had a
      frank, attractive face. He was naturally of a cheerful temperament, but at
      present his face was grave, and not without a shade of anxiety. This can
      hardly be a matter of surprise when we consider that he was thrown upon
      his own resources, and that his available capital consisted of
      thirty-seven cents in money, in addition to a good education and a rather
      unusual amount of physical strength. These last two items were certainly
      valuable, but they cannot always be exchanged for the necessaries and
      comforts of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time his steps had been lagging, and from time to time he had to
      wipe the moisture from his brow with a fine linen handkerchief, which
      latter seemed hardly compatible with his almost destitute condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hasten to introduce my hero, for such he is to be, as Carl Crawford, son
      of Dr. Paul Crawford, of Edgewood Center. Why he had set out to conquer
      fortune single-handed will soon appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few rods ahead Carl&rsquo;s attention was drawn to a wide-spreading oak tree,
      with a carpet of verdure under its sturdy boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will rest here for a little while,&rdquo; he said to himself, and suiting the
      action to the word, threw down his gripsack and flung himself on the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is refreshing,&rdquo; he murmured, as, lying upon his back, he looked up
      through the leafy rifts to the sky above. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I have ever
      been so tired. It&rsquo;s no joke walking a dozen miles under a hot sun, with a
      heavy gripsack in your hand. It&rsquo;s a good introduction to a life of labor,
      which I have reason to believe is before me. I wonder how I am coming out&mdash;at
      the big or the little end of the horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and his face grew grave, for he understood well that for him
      life had become a serious matter. In his absorption he did not observe the
      rapid approach of a boy somewhat younger than himself, mounted on a
      bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stopped short in surprise, and leaped from his iron steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Carl Crawford, is this you? Where in the world are you going with
      that gripsack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to seek my fortune,&rdquo; he answered, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll find it. Don&rsquo;t chaff, though, but tell the honest
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you the truth, Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a puzzled look, Gilbert, first leaning his bicycle against the tree,
      seated himself on the ground by Carl&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your father lost his property?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he disinherited you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you left home for good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left home&mdash;I hope for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you quarreled with the governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know what to say to that. There is a difference between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem like a Roman father&mdash;one who rules his family with a
      rod of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is quite the reverse. He hasn&rsquo;t backbone enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seemed to me when I saw him at the exhibition of the academy. You
      ought to be able to get along with a father like that, Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I could but for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a stepmother!&rdquo; said Carl, with a significant glance at his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I, but she is the soul of kindness, and makes our home the
      dearest place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there such stepmothers? I shouldn&rsquo;t have judged so from my own
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I love her as much as if she were my own mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky,&rdquo; said Carl, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was married to my father five years ago. Up to the time of her
      marriage I thought her amiable and sweet-tempered. But soon after the
      wedding she threw off the mask, and made it clear that she disliked me.
      One reason is that she has a son of her own about my age, a mean, sneaking
      fellow, who is the apple of her eye. She has been jealous of me, and tried
      to supplant me in the affection of my father, wishing Peter to be the
      favored son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has she succeeded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think my father feels any love for Peter, but through my
      stepmother&rsquo;s influence he generally fares better than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t he sent to school with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is lazy and doesn&rsquo;t like study. Besides, his mother prefers to
      have him at home. During my absence she worked upon my father, by telling
      all sorts of malicious stories about me, till he became estranged from me,
      and little by little Peter has usurped my place as the favorite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you deny the stories?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, but no credit was given to my denials. My stepmother was
      continually poisoning my father&rsquo;s mind against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give her cause? Did you behave disrespectfully to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Carl, warmly. &ldquo;I was prepared to give her a warm welcome,
      and treat her as a friend, but my advances were so coldly received that my
      heart was chilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Carl! How long has this been so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the beginning&mdash;ever since Mrs. Crawford came into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your relations with your step-brother&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Cook. I despise the boy, for he is mean, and tyrannical where he
      dares to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be safe for him to bully you, Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried it, and got a good thrashing. You can imagine what followed. He
      ran, crying to his mother, and his version of the story was believed. I
      was confined to my room for a week, and forced to live on bread and
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think your father was a man to inflict such a punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t he&mdash;it was my stepmother. She insisted upon it, and he
      yielded. I heard afterwards from one of the servants that he wanted me
      released at the end of twenty-four hours, but she would not consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened when I was twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it ever repeated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a month later; but the punishment lasted only for two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you submitted to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to, but as soon as I was released I gave Peter such a flogging,
      with the promise to repeat it, if I was ever punished in that manner
      again, that the boy himself was panic-stricken, and objected to my being
      imprisoned again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a charming fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would think so if you should see him. He has small, insignificant
      features, a turn-up nose, and an ugly scowl that appears whenever he is
      out of humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet your father likes him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he does, though Peter, by his mother&rsquo;s orders, pays all
      sorts of small attentions&mdash;bringing him his slippers, running on
      errands, and so on, not because he likes it, but because he wants to
      supplant me, as he has succeeded in doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have finally broken away, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. Home had become intolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon the question, but hasn&rsquo;t your father got considerable property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have every reason to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your leaving home give your step-mother and Peter the inside track,
      and lead, perhaps, to your disinheritance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Carl, wearily; &ldquo;but no matter what happens, I
      can&rsquo;t bear to stay at home any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re badly fixed&mdash;that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; said Gilbert, in a tone of
      sympathy. &ldquo;What are your plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t had time to think.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gilbert wrinkled up his forehead and set about trying to form some plans
      for Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be hard for you to support yourself,&rdquo; he said, after a pause;
      &ldquo;that is, without help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one to help me. I expect no help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought your father might be induced to give you an allowance, so that
      with what you can earn, you may get along comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think father would be willing to do this, but my stepmother would
      prevent him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has a great deal of influence over him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she can twist him round her little finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, father is an invalid, and is very nervous. If he were in perfect
      health he would have more force of character and firmness. He is under the
      impression that he has heart disease, and it makes him timid and
      vacillating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still he ought to do something for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he ought. Still, Gilbert, I think I can earn my living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a fair education. I could be an entry clerk, or a salesman
      in some store, or, if the worst came to the worst, I could work on a farm.
      I believe farmers give boys who work for them their board and clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the clothes would suit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pretty well supplied with clothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert looked significantly at the gripsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you carry it all in there?&rdquo; he asked, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have a trunkful of clothes at home, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring them with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would if I were an elephant. Being only a boy, I would find it
      burdensome carrying a trunk with me. The gripsack is all I can very well
      manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;Come round to our house and stay
      overnight. We live only a mile from here, you know. The folks will be glad
      to see you, and while you are there I will go to your house, see the
      governor, and arrange for an allowance for you that will make you
      comparatively independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Gilbert; but I don&rsquo;t feel like asking favors from those who
      have ill-treated me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would I&mdash;of strangers; but Dr. Crawford is your father. It isn&rsquo;t
      right that Peter, your stepbrother, should be supported in ease and
      luxury, while you, the real son, should be subjected to privation and
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you are right,&rdquo; admitted Carl, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am right. Now, will you make me your minister
      plenipotentiary, armed with full powers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That shows you are a boy of sense. Now, as you are subject
      to my directions, just get on that bicycle and I will carry your gripsack,
      and we will seek Vance Villa, as we call it when we want to be high-toned,
      by the most direct route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Gilbert; I will carry my own gripsack. I won&rsquo;t burden you with
      it,&rdquo; said Carl, rising from his recumbent position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Carl, how far have you walked with it this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twelve miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, you&rsquo;re tired, and require rest. Just jump on that
      bicycle, and I&rsquo;ll take the gripsack. If you have carried it twelve miles,
      I can surely carry it one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is imposing up on your good nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gilbert had turned his head in a backward direction, and nodded in a
      satisfied way as he saw a light, open buggy rapidly approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my sister in that carriage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She comes in good time. I
      will put you and your gripsack in with her, and I&rsquo;ll take to my bicycle
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister may not like such an arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she though! She&rsquo;s very fond of beaux, and she will receive you very
      graciously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me feel bashful, Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be long. Julia will chat away to you as if she&rsquo;d known you for
      fifty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very young fifty years ago,&rdquo; said Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there, Jule!&rdquo; called Gilbert, waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Vance stopped the horse, and looked inquiringly and rather
      admiringly at Carl, who was a boy of fine appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce you to my friend and schoolmate, Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl took off his hat politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said Julia,
      demurely; &ldquo;I have often heard Gilbert speak of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he said nothing bad about me, Miss Vance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure he didn&rsquo;t. If he should now&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a favorable impression, Carl,&rdquo; said Gilbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am naturally prejudiced against boys&mdash;having such a brother,&rdquo; said
      Julia; &ldquo;but it is not fair to judge all boys by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is outrageous injustice!&rdquo; said Gilbert; &ldquo;but then, sisters seldom
      appreciate their brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some other fellows&rsquo; sisters may,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, they do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a vain, conceited boy, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know him better than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Carl; it&rsquo;s too bad for you, too, to join against me. However, I
      will forget and forgive. Jule, my friend, Carl, has accepted my invitation
      to make us a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad, I am sure,&rdquo; said Julia, sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want you to take him in, bag and baggage, and convey him to our
      palace, while I speed thither on my wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I will, and with great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get out and assist him into the carriage, Jule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Carl; &ldquo;but though I am somewhat old and quite infirm, I
      think I can get in without troubling your sister. Are you sure, Miss
      Vance, you won&rsquo;t be incommoded by my gripsack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will accept your kind offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a trice Carl was seated next to Julia, with his valise at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you drive, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo; said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me take the reins from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it looks well for a lady to drive when a gentleman is
      sitting beside her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was glad to take the reins, for he liked driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a race!&rdquo; said Gilbert, who was mounted on his bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; replied Carl. &ldquo;Look out for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started, and the two kept neck and neck till they entered the
      driveway leading up to a handsome country mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl followed them into the house, and was cordially received by Mr. and
      Mrs. Vance, who were very kind and hospitable, and were favorably
      impressed by the gentlemanly appearance of their son&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later dinner was announced, and Carl, having removed the
      stains of travel in his schoolmate&rsquo;s room, descended to the dining-room,
      and, it must be confessed, did ample justice to the bounteous repast
      spread before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Julia, Gilbert and he played tennis, and had a trial at
      archery. The hours glided away very rapidly, and six o&rsquo;clock came before
      they were aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; said Carl, as they were preparing for tea, &ldquo;you have a charming
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a nice house, too, Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but it isn&rsquo;t a home&mdash;to me. There is no love there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes a great difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had a father and mother like yours I should be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay here till day after tomorrow, and I will devote to-morrow
      to a visit in your interest to your home. I will beard the lion in his den&mdash;that
      is, your stepmother. Do you consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I consent; but it won&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      INTRODUCES PETER COOK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gilbert took the morning train to the town of Edgewood Center, the
      residence of the Crawfords. He had been there before, and knew that Carl&rsquo;s
      home was nearly a mile distant from the station. Though there was a hack
      in waiting, he preferred to walk, as it would give him a chance to think
      over what he proposed to say to Dr. Crawford in Carl&rsquo;s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was within a quarter of a mile of his destination when his attention
      was drawn to a boy of about his own age, who was amusing himself and a
      smaller companion by firing stones at a cat that had taken refuge in a
      tree. Just as Gilbert came up, a stone took effect, and the poor cat
      moaned in affright, but did not dare to come down from her perch, as this
      would put her in the power of her assailant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be Carl&rsquo;s stepbrother, Peter,&rdquo; Gilbert decided, as he noted the
      boy&rsquo;s mean face and turn-up nose. &ldquo;Stoning cats seems to be his idea of
      amusement. I shall take the liberty of interfering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Cook laughed heartily at his successful aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hit her, Simon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look seared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have hurt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect I did. I&rsquo;ll take a bigger stone next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suited the action to the word, and picked up a rock which, should it
      hit the poor cat, would in all probability kill her, and prepared to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that rock!&rdquo; said Gilbert, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned quickly, and eyed Gilbert insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter who I am. Put down that rock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make it my business to protect that cat from your cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, who was a natural coward, took courage from having a companion to
      back him up, and retorted: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better clear out of here, or I may fire
      at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it if you dare!&rdquo; said Gilbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter concluded that it would be wiser not to carry out his threat, but
      was resolved to keep to his original purpose. He raised his arm again, and
      took aim; but Gilbert rushed in, and striking his arm forcibly, compelled
      him to drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, you loafer?&rdquo; demanded Peter, his eyes blazing
      with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stop your fun, if that&rsquo;s what you call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to give you a thrashing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert put himself in a position of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sail in, if you want to!&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me, Simon!&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;You grab his legs, and I&rsquo;ll upset him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon, who, though younger, was braver than Peter, without hesitation
      followed directions. He threw himself on the ground and grasped Gilbert by
      the legs, while Peter, doubling up his fists, made a rush at his enemy.
      But Gilbert, swiftly eluding Simon, struck out with his right arm, and
      Peter, unprepared for so forcible a defense, tumbled over on his back, and
      Simon ran to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert put himself on guard, expecting a second attack; but Peter
      apparently thought it wiser to fight with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; he shrieked, almost foaming at the mouth; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you
      arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For flying at me like a&mdash;a tiger, and trying to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert laughed at this curious version of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was you who flew at me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business had you to interfere with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it again unless you give up firing stones at the cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it as long as I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked up into the tree, and could see nothing of puss. She had
      taken the opportunity, when her assailant was otherwise occupied, to make
      good her escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it!&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;Good-morning, boys! When we meet again, I
      hope you will be more creditably employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get off so easy, you loafer,&rdquo; said Peter, who saw the village
      constable approaching. &ldquo;Here, Mr. Rogers, I want you to arrest this boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Constable Rogers, who was a stout, broad-shouldered man, nearly six feet
      in height, turned from one to the other, and asked: &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knocked me over. I want him arrested for assault and battery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather strange. Young man, what is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Vance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t live in this town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I live in Warren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you attack Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he flew at me, and I had to defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this so, Simon? You saw all that happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; admitted Simon, unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That puts a different face on the matter. I don&rsquo;t see how I can arrest
      this boy. He had a right to defend himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came up and abused me&mdash;the loafer,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the reason you went at him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to say?&rdquo; asked the constable, addressing Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; when I came up I saw this boy firing stones at a cat, who had
      taken refuge in that tree over there. He had just hit her, and had picked
      up a larger stone to fire when I ordered him to drop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no business of yours,&rdquo; muttered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made it my business, and will again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the cat have a white spot on her forehead?&rdquo; asked the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was mouse colored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s my little girl&rsquo;s cat. She would be heartbroken if the cat were
      seriously hurt. You young rascal!&rdquo; he continued, turning suddenly upon
      Peter, and shaking him vigorously. &ldquo;Let me catch you at this business
      again, and I&rsquo;ll give you such a warming that you&rsquo;ll never want to touch
      another cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried the terrified boy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was your cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been just as bad if it had been somebody else&rsquo;s cat. I&rsquo;ve a
      great mind to put you in the lockup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, please don&rsquo;t, Mr. Rogers!&rdquo; implored Peter, quite
      panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise never to stone another cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go about your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter lost no time, but scuttled up the street with his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for protecting Flora&rsquo;s cat,&rdquo; then said the
      constable to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite welcome, sir. I won&rsquo;t see any animal abused if I can help
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that boy Peter Cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I know his stepbrother, Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A different sort of boy! Have you come to visit him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is visiting me. In fact, he has left home, because he could not
      stand his step-mother&rsquo;s ill-treatment, and I have come to see his father
      in his behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had an uncomfortable home. Dr. Crawford is an invalid, and very
      much under the influence of his wife, who seems to have a spite against
      Carl, and is devoted to that young cub to whom you have given a lesson.
      Does Carl want to come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he wants to strike out for himself, but I told him it was no more
      than right that he should receive some help from his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true enough. For nearly all the doctor&rsquo;s money came to him
      through Carl&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Peter and his mother won&rsquo;t give me a very cordial welcome
      after what has happened this morning. I wish I could see the doctor
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you can, for there he is coming up the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert looked in the direction indicated, and his glance fell on a thin,
      fragile-looking man, evidently an invalid, with a weak, undecided face,
      who was slowly approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy advanced to meet him, and, taking off his hat, asked politely: &ldquo;Is
      this Dr. Crawford?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford stopped short, and eyed Gilbert attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; he said, in a querulous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a schoolmate of your son, Carl. My name is Gilbert Vance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have come to see my son you will be disappointed. He has treated
      me in a shameful manner. He left home yesterday morning, and I don&rsquo;t know
      where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, sir. He is staying&mdash;for a day or two&mdash;at my
      father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo; asked Dr. Crawford, his manner showing that he was
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Warren, thirteen miles from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the town. What induced him to go to your house? Have you
      encouraged him to leave home?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Crawford, with a look of
      displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. It was only by chance that I met him a mile from our home. I
      induced him to stay overnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you bring me any message from him?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir, except that he is going
      to strike out for himself, as he thinks his home an unhappy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is his own fault. He has had enough to eat and enough to wear. He
      has had as comfortable a home as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that, but he complains that his stepmother is continually
      finding fault with him, and scolding him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He provokes her to do it. He is a headstrong, obstinate boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never had that reputation at school, sir. We all liked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean to imply that I am in fault?&rdquo; said the doctor, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know how badly Mrs. Crawford treats Carl, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course. That is always said of a stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, sir. I have a stepmother myself, and no own mother could
      treat me better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably a better boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept the compliment. I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying it, Dr.
      Crawford, but if my stepmother treated me as Carl says Mrs. Crawford
      treats him I wouldn&rsquo;t stay in the house another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, this is very annoying,&rdquo; said Dr. Crawford, irritably. &ldquo;Have you
      come here from Warren to say this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Carl wants me to receive him back. I will do so if he promises to
      obey his stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he won&rsquo;t do, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is the object of your visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say that Carl wants and intends to earn his own living. But it is hard
      for a boy of his age, who has never worked, to earn enough at first to pay
      for his board and clothes. He asks, or, rather, I ask for him, that you
      will allow him a small sum, say three or four dollars a week, which is
      considerably less than he must cost you at home, for a time until he gets
      on his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dr. Crawford, in a vacillating tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      Mrs. Crawford would approve this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me you are the one to decide, as Carl is your own son. Peter
      must cost you a good deal more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met him,&rdquo; answered Gilbert, with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. You may be right. Peter does cost me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Carl is entitled to be treated as well as he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to speak to Mrs. Crawford about it. And, by the way, I
      nearly forgot to say that she charges Carl with taking money from her
      bureau drawer before he went away. It was a large sum, too&mdash;twenty-five
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is false!&rdquo; exclaimed Gilbert, indignantly. &ldquo;I am surprised that you
      should believe such a thing of your own son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford says she has proof,&rdquo; said the doctor, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what has he done with the money? I know that he has but thirty-seven
      cents with him at this time, and he only left home yesterday. If the money
      has really been taken, I think I know who took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Cook. He looks mean enough for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you to speak so of Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I caught him stoning a cat this morning. He would have killed the
      poor thing if I had not interfered. I consider that worse than taking
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I can&rsquo;t agree to anything till I have
      spoken with Mrs. Crawford. Did you say that Carl had but thirty seven
      cents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I presume you don&rsquo;t want him to starve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. He is my son, though he has behaved badly. Here, give
      him that!&rdquo; and Dr. Crawford drew a ten-dollar bill from his wallet, and
      handed it to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. This money will be very useful. Besides, it will show
      Carl that his father is not wholly indifferent to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Who says that I am a bad father?&rdquo; asked Dr. Crawford,
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, sir, there would be any difficulty between you and Carl if
      you had not married again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl has no right to vex Mrs. Crawford. Besides, he can&rsquo;t agree with
      Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that his fault or Peter&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not acquainted with the circumstances, but Mrs. Crawford says that
      Carl is always bullying Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never bullied anyone at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything, else you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; Carl only took away a little underclothing in a gripsack. He
      would like his woolen clothes put in his trunk, and to have it sent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it had better be sent to my house. There are one or two things in
      his room also that he asked me to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he thought it would be unpleasant for him to meet Mrs. Crawford.
      They would be sure to quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps he is right,&rdquo; said Dr. Crawford, with an air of relief.
      &ldquo;About the allowance, I shall have to consult my wife. Will you come with
      me to the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I should like to have the matter settled to-day, so that Carl
      will know what to depend upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert rather dreaded the interview he was likely to have with Mrs.
      Crawford; but he was acting for Carl, and his feelings of friendship were
      strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he walked beside Dr. Crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling
      occupied as a residence by Carl and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy Carl could be here, if he had a stepmother like mine,&rdquo; Gilbert
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up to the front door, which was opened for them by a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane, is Mrs. Crawford in?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; not just now. She went to the village to do some shopping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Peter in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will have to wait till they return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go up to Carl&rsquo;s room and be packing his things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think you may. I don&rsquo;t think Mrs. Crawford would object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! Hasn&rsquo;t the man a mind of his own?&rdquo; thought Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane, you may show this young gentleman up to Master Carl&rsquo;s room, and
      give him the key of his trunk. He is going to pack his clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is Master Carl coming back?&rdquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I think he will be away for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it was Peter instead of him,&rdquo; said Jane, in a low voice, only
      audible to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed Gilbert the way upstairs, while the doctor went to his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a friend of Master Carl&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Jane, as soon as they were
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he goin&rsquo; to stay there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a short time. He wants to go out into the world and make his own
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no wonder&mdash;poor boy! It&rsquo;s hard times he had here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Crawford treat him well?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, with curiosity
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it trate him well? She was a-jawin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-jawin&rsquo; him from mornin&rsquo; till
      night. Ugh, but she&rsquo;s an ugly cr&rsquo;atur&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just as bad&mdash;the m&rsquo;anest bye I iver set eyes on. It would do me
      good to see him flogged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chatted a little longer with Gilbert, helping him to find Carl&rsquo;s
      clothes, when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure, it&rsquo;s the madam!&rdquo; said Jane, shrugging her shoulders. &ldquo;I expect
      she&rsquo;s in a temper;&rdquo; and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL&rsquo;S STEPMOTHER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, as Gilbert was closing the trunk, Jane reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor and Mrs. Crawford would like to see you downstairs,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert followed Jane into the library, where Dr. Crawford and his wife
      were seated. He looked with interest at the woman who had made home so
      disagreeable to Carl, and was instantly prejudiced against her. She was
      light complexioned, with very light-brown hair, cold, gray eyes, and a
      disagreeable expression which seemed natural to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;this is the young man who has come from
      Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford surveyed Gilbert with an expression by no means friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Vance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Carl Crawford send you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I volunteered to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you that he was disobedient and disrespectful to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he told me that you treated him so badly that he was unwilling to
      live in the same house with you,&rdquo; answered Gilbert, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, fanning herself vigorously.
      &ldquo;Dr. Crawford, did you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you may have been too hard upon Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too hard? Why, then, did he not treat me respectfully? This boy seems
      inclined to be impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered your questions, madam,&rdquo; said Gilbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you side with your friend Carl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the object of your coming? Does Carl wish to return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Dr. Crawford might have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl wants his clothes sent to him,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He only carried a
      few with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not consent to it. He deserves no favors at our hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much even for Dr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go too far, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am sensible of the boy&rsquo;s
      faults, but I certainly will not allow his clothes to be withheld from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! spoil him if you choose!&rdquo; said the lady, sullenly. &ldquo;Take his
      part against your wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never done that, but I will not allow him to be defrauded of his
      clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no more to say,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, her eyes snapping. She was
      clearly mortified at her failure to carry her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish the trunk to be sent to your house?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I have packed the clothes and locked the trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to examine it before it goes,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Crawford,
      spitefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make sure that nothing has been put in that does not belong to Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to accuse me of stealing, madam?&rdquo; demanded Gilbert,
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about you,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Crawford, am I to open the trunk?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the doctor, with unwonted decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate that boy! He has twice subjected me to mortification,&rdquo; thought
      Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; she said, turning to her husband, &ldquo;that I have
      grounds for my request. I blush to mention it, but I have reason to
      believe that your son took a wallet containing twenty-five dollars from my
      bureau drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it!&rdquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it, I should like to ask?&rdquo; sneered Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that Carl is an honorable boy, incapable of theft, and at this
      moment has but thirty-seven cents in his possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the money has really disappeared, madam, you had better ask your own
      boy about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is insufferable!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, her light eyes emitting
      angry flashes. &ldquo;Who dares to say that Peter took the wallet?&rdquo; she went on,
      rising to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unexpected reply. Jane entered the room at this moment to ask
      a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Crawford, with startling emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say anything about it till I found you were charging it
      on Master Carl. I saw Peter open your bureau drawer, take out the wallet,
      and put it in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth, though I suppose you don&rsquo;t want to believe it. If you
      want to know what he did with the money ask him how much he paid for the
      gold ring he bought of the jeweler down at the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a spy&mdash;a base, dishonorable spy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say what you are, ma&rsquo;am, to bring false charges against Master
      Carl, and I wonder the doctor will believe them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the house directly, you hussy!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do, I wonder who&rsquo;ll get the dinner?&rdquo; remarked Jane, not at all
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay here to be insulted,&rdquo; said the angry lady. &ldquo;Dr. Crawford,
      you might have spirit enough to defend your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flounced out of the room, not waiting for a reply, leaving the doctor
      dazed and flurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir, you are convinced now that Carl did not take Mrs. Crawford&rsquo;s
      money,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;I told you it was probably Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of what you said, Jane?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I saw Peter take the wallet with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his mother&rsquo;s money, and they must settle it between them I am glad
      Carl did not take it. Really, this has been a very unpleasant scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for my part in it. Carl is my friend, and I feel that I ought
      to stand up for his rights,&rdquo; remarked Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly, that is right. But you see how I am placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that this is no place for Carl. If you will allow me, I will send
      an expressman for the trunk, and take it with me to the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see no objection. I&mdash;I would invite you to dinner, but Mrs.
      Crawford seems to be suffering from a nervous attack, and it might not be
      pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Peter entered the room, and looked at Gilbert with surprise and
      wrath, remembering his recent discomfiture at the hands of the young
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My stepson, Peter,&rdquo; announced Dr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter and I have met before,&rdquo; said Gilbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you here for?&rdquo; asked Peter, rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to see you,&rdquo; answered Gilbert, turning from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;ll have something to say to you,&rdquo; went on Peter, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will have something to say to you,&rdquo; retorted Gilbert. &ldquo;She has found
      out who stole her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s face turned scarlet instantly, and he left the room hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought not to have said that, Dr Crawford,&rdquo; added Gilbert,
      apologetically, &ldquo;but I dislike that boy very much, and couldn&rsquo;t help
      giving him as good as he sent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very unpleasant,&rdquo; responded Dr. Crawford, peevishly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      see why I can&rsquo;t live in peace and tranquility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t intrude upon you any longer,&rdquo; said Gilbert, &ldquo;if you will kindly
      tell me whether you will consent to make Carl a small weekly allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say now. I want time to think. Give me your address, and I will
      write to Carl in your care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert left the house and made arrangements to have Carl&rsquo;s trunk called
      for. It accompanied him on the next train to Warren.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Mrs. CRAWFORD&rsquo;S LETTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you like my stepmother?&rdquo; asked Carl, when Gilbert returned in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a daisy!&rdquo; answered Gilbert, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      I ever saw a more disagreeable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you blame me for leaving home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wonder you have been able to stay so long. I had a long
      conversation with your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford has made a different man of him. I should have no trouble
      in getting along with him if there was no one to come between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me this for you,&rdquo; said Gilbert, producing the ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my stepmother know of his sending it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she was opposed to sending your trunk, but your father said
      emphatically you should have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad he showed that much spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some hopes that he will make you an allowance of a few dollars a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would make me all right, but I don&rsquo;t expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will probably hear from your father to-morrow or next day, so you
      will have to make yourself contented a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not very homesick, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo; said Julia,
      coquettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask nothing better than to stay here permanently,&rdquo; rejoined Carl,
      earnestly. &ldquo;This is a real home. I have met with more kindness here than
      in six months at my own home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have one staunch friend at home,&rdquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t allude to Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can judge, he hates you like poison. I mean Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jane is a real friend. She has been in the family for ten years. She
      was a favorite with my own mother, and feels an interest in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, your stepmother&rsquo;s charge that you took a wallet containing
      money from her drawer has been disproved by Jane. She saw Peter
      abstracting the money, and so informed Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprised. Peter is mean enough to steal or do anything
      else. What did my stepmother say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very angry, and threatened to discharge Jane; but, as no one
      would be left to attend to the dinner, I presume she is likely to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be forming some plan,&rdquo; said Carl, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you hear from home. Julia will see that your time is well
      filled up till then. Dismiss all care, and enjoy yourself while you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to be sensible advice, and Carl followed it. In the evening
      some young people were invited in, and there was a round of amusements
      that made Carl forget that he was an exile from home, with very dubious
      prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all spoiling me,&rdquo; he said, as Gilbert and he went upstairs to
      bed. &ldquo;I am beginning to understand the charms of home. To go out into the
      world from here will be like taking a cold shower bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never forget, Carl, that you will be welcome back, whenever you feel like
      coming,&rdquo; said Gilbert, laying his band affectionately on Carl&rsquo;s shoulder.
      &ldquo;We all like you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, old fellow! I appreciate the kindness I have received here;
      but I must strike out for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel about it, Carl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope for the best. I am young, strong and willing to work. There must
      be an opening for me somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, just after breakfast, a letter arrived for Carl, mailed
      at Edgewood Center.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it from your father?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is in the handwriting of my stepmother. I can guess from that that
      it contains no good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the letter, and as he read it his face expressed disgust and
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, Gilbert,&rdquo; he said, handing him the open sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the missive:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CARL CRAWFORD:&mdash;AS your father has a nervous attack, brought on by
      your misconduct, he has authorized me to write to you. As you are but
      sixteen, he could send for you and have you forcibly brought back, but
      deems it better for you to follow your own course and suffer the
      punishment of your obstinate and perverse conduct. The boy whom you sent
      here proved a fitting messenger. He seems, if possible, to be even worse
      than yourself. He was very impertinent to me, and made a brutal and
      unprovoked attack on my poor boy, Peter, whose devotion to your father and
      myself forms an agreeable contrast to your studied disregard of our
      wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend had the assurance to ask for a weekly allowance for you while
      a voluntary exile from the home where you have been only too well treated.
      In other words, you want to be paid for your disobedience. Even if your
      father were weak enough to think of complying with this extraordinary
      request, I should do my best to dissuade him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small doubt of that!&rdquo; said Carl, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my sorrow for your waywardness, I am comforted by the thought that
      Peter is too good and conscientious ever to follow your example. While you
      are away, he will do his utmost to make up to your father for his
      disappointment in you. That you may grow wise in time, and turn at length
      from the error of your ways, is the earnest hope of your stepmother,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anastasia Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me sick to read such a letter as that, Gilbert,&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;And
      to have that sneak and thief&mdash;as he turned out to be&mdash;Peter, set
      up as a model for me, is a little too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew there were such women in the world!&rdquo; returned Gilbert. &ldquo;I
      can understand your feelings perfectly, after my interview of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks even worse of you than of me,&rdquo; said Carl, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt Peter shares her sentiments. I didn&rsquo;t make many friends
      in your family, it must be confessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did me a service, Gilbert, and I shall not soon forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did your stepmother come from?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My father met her at some summer resort. She was staying in
      the same boarding house, she and the angelic Peter. She lost no time in
      setting her cap for my father, who was doubtless reported to her as a man
      of property, and she succeeded in capturing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at that. She doesn&rsquo;t seem very fascinating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made herself very agreeable to my father, and was even affectionate
      in her manner to me, though I couldn&rsquo;t get to like her. The end was that
      she became Mrs. Crawford. Once installed in our house, she soon threw off
      the mask and showed herself in her true colors, a cold-hearted, selfish
      and disagreeable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder your father doesn&rsquo;t recognize her for what she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very artful, and is politic enough to treat him well. She has lost
      no opportunity of prejudicing him against me. If he were not an invalid
      she would find her task more difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she have any property when your father married her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I have been able to discover. She is scheming to have my father
      leave the lion&rsquo;s share of his property to her and Peter. I dare say she
      will succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope your father will live till you are a young man, at least, and
      better able to cope with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I earnestly hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is not an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is fifty-one, but he is not strong. I believe he has liver complaint.
      At any rate, I know that when, at my stepmother&rsquo;s instigation, he applied
      to an insurance company to insure his life for her benefit, the
      application was rejected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything of Mrs. Crawford&rsquo;s antecedents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her name before she married your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a Mrs. Cook. That, as you know, is Peter&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, in your travels, you may learn something of her history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t leave us to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to-day. I know now that I must depend wholly upon my own
      exertions, and I must get to work as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write to me, Carl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when I have anything agreeable to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope that will be soon.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ENDS IN A TRAGEDY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl obtained permission to leave his trunk at the Vance mansion, merely
      taking out what he absolutely needed for a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am settled I will send for it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I shouldn&rsquo;t know
      what to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were cordial good-bys, and Carl started once more on the tramp. He
      might, indeed, have traveled by rail, for he had ten dollars and
      thirty-seven cents; but it occurred to him that in walking he might meet
      with some one who would give him employment. Besides, he was not in a
      hurry to get on, nor had he any definite destination. The day was fine,
      there was a light breeze, and he experienced a hopeful exhilaration as he
      walked lightly on, with the world before him, and any number of
      possibilities in the way of fortunate adventures that might befall him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked five miles, when, to the left, he saw an elderly man hard at
      work in a hay field. He was leaning on his rake, and looking perplexed and
      troubled. Carl paused to rest, and as he looked over the rail fence,
      attracted the attention of the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, young feller, where are you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where you are goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; repeated the farmer, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl laughed. &ldquo;I am going out in the world to seek my fortune,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be? Would you like a job?&rdquo; asked the farmer, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you help me hayin&rsquo;. My hired man is sick, and he&rsquo;s left
      me in a hole. It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to rain, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to rain?&rdquo; repeated Carl, in surprise, as he looked up at the nearly
      cloudless sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It don&rsquo;t look like it, I know, but old Job Hagar say it&rsquo;ll rain
      before night, and what he don&rsquo;t know about the weather ain&rsquo;t worth
      knowin&rsquo;. I want to get the hay on this meadow into the barn, and then I&rsquo;ll
      feel safe, rain or shine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want me to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you look strong and hardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am pretty strong,&rdquo; said Carl, complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl gave a spring and cleared the fence, landing in the hay field, having
      first thrown his valise over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty spry,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re too heavy,&rdquo; said Carl, smiling, as he noted the clumsy figure
      of his employer. &ldquo;Now, what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that rake and rake up the hay. Then we&rsquo;ll go over to the barn and
      get the hay wagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your barn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer pointed across the fields to a story-and-a-half farmhouse, and
      standing near it a good-sized barn, brown from want of paint and exposure
      to sun and rain. The buildings were perhaps twenty-five rods distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you used to hayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly; though I&rsquo;ve handled a rake before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl&rsquo;s experience, however, had been very limited. He had, to be sure, had
      a rake in his hand, but probably he had not worked more than ten minutes
      at it. However, raking is easily learned, and his want of experience was
      not detected. He started off with great enthusiasm, but after a while
      thought it best to adopt the more leisurely movements of the farmer. After
      two hours his hands began to blister, but still he kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got to make my living by hard work,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and it
      won&rsquo;t do to let such a little thing as a blister interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had been working a couple of hours, he began to feel hungry. His
      walk, and the work he had been doing, sharpened his appetite till he
      really felt uncomfortable. It was at this time&mdash;just twelve o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that
      the farmer&rsquo;s wife came to the front door and blew a fish horn so
      vigorously that it could probably have been heard half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old woman&rsquo;s got dinner ready,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind
      takin&rsquo; your pay in victuals, you can go along home with me, and take a
      bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could take two or three, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho! that&rsquo;s a good joke! Money&rsquo;s scarce, and I&rsquo;d rather pay in
      victuals, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you generally find people willing to work for their board?&rdquo; asked
      Carl, who knew that he was being imposed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I might pay a leetle more. You work for me till sundown, and I&rsquo;ll
      give you dinner and supper, and&mdash;fifteen cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl wanted to laugh. At this rate of compensation he felt that it would
      take a long time to make a fortune, but he was so hungry that he would
      have accepted board alone if it had been necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I leave my rake here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take along my valise, for I can&rsquo;t afford to run any risk of losing
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes brought them to the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I wash my hands?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can go right to the sink and wash in the tin basin. There&rsquo;s a
      roll towel behind the door. Mis&rsquo; Perkins&rdquo;&mdash;that was the way he
      addressed his wife&mdash;&ldquo;this is a young chap that I&rsquo;ve hired to help me
      hayin&rsquo;. You can set a chair for him at the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Silas. He don&rsquo;t look very old, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am. I ain&rsquo;t twenty-one yet,&rdquo; answered Carl, who was really
      sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say you was. You ain&rsquo;t no signs of a mustache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep it short, ma&rsquo;am, in warm weather,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t dull a razor any to cut it in cold weather, does it?&rdquo; asked the
      farmer, chuckling at his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, sir; I can&rsquo;t say it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a boiled dinner that the farmer&rsquo;s wife provided, corned beef and
      vegetables, but the plebeian meal seemed to Carl the best he ever ate.
      Afterwards there was apple pudding, to which he did equal justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew work improved a fellow&rsquo;s appetite so,&rdquo; reflected the young
      traveler. &ldquo;I never ate with so much relish at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they went back to the field and worked till the supper hour,
      five o&rsquo;clock. By that time all the hay had been put into the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done a good day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said the farmer, in a tone of
      satisfaction, &ldquo;and only just in time. Do you see that dark cloud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour there&rsquo;ll be rain, or I&rsquo;m mistaken. Old Job Hagar is right
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer proved a true prophet. In half an hour, while they were at the
      supper table, the rain began to come down in large drops&mdash;forming
      pools in the hollows of the ground, and drenching all exposed objects with
      the largesse of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where war you a-goin&rsquo; to-night?&rdquo; asked the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d give you a night&rsquo;s lodgin&rsquo; in place of the
      fifteen cents I agreed to pay you. Money&rsquo;s very skeerce with me, and will
      be till I&rsquo;ve sold off some of the crops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to make that arrangement,&rdquo; said Carl, who had been
      considering how much the farmer would ask for lodging, for there seemed
      small chance of continuing his journey. Fifteen cents was a lower price
      than he had calculated on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sensible idea!&rdquo; said the farmer, rubbing his hands with
      satisfaction at the thought that he had secured valuable help at no money
      outlay whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Carl continued his tramp, refusing the offer of continued
      employment on the same terms. He was bent on pursuing his journey, though
      he did not know exactly where he would fetch up in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock that day he found himself in the outskirts of a town,
      with the same uncomfortable appetite that he had felt the day before, but
      with no hotel or restaurant anywhere near. There was, however, a small
      house, the outer door of which stood conveniently open. Through the open
      window, Carl saw a table spread as if for dinner, and he thought it
      probable that he could arrange to become a boarder for a single meal. He
      knocked at the door, but no one came. He shouted out: &ldquo;Is anybody at
      home?&rdquo; and received no answer. He went to a small barn just outside and
      peered in, but no one was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should he do? He was terribly hungry, and the sight of the food on
      the table was tantalizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in, as the door is open,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;and sit down to the table
      and eat. Somebody will be along before I get through, and I&rsquo;ll pay
      whatever is satisfactory, for eat I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered, seated himself, and ate heartily. Still no one appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go off without paying,&rdquo; thought Carl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can
      find somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door into the kitchen, but it was deserted. Then he opened
      that of a small bedroom, and started back in terror and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There suspended from a hook&mdash;a man of middle age was hanging, with
      his head bent forward, his eyes wide open, and his tongue protruding from
      his mouth!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL FALLS UNDER SUSPICION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      To a person of any age such a sight as that described at the close of the
      last chapter might well have proved startling. To a boy like Carl it was
      simply overwhelming. It so happened that he had but twice seen a dead
      person, and never a victim of violence. The peculiar circumstances
      increased the effect upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed his hand upon the man&rsquo;s face, and found that he was still warm.
      He could have been dead but a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; thought Carl, perplexed. &ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it flashed upon him that as he was alone with the dead man suspicion
      might fall upon him as being concerned in what might be called a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better leave here at once,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I shall have to go away
      without paying for my meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started to leave the house, but had scarcely reached the door when two
      persons&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;entered. Both looked at Carl with
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; answered Carl; &ldquo;I was very hungry, and seeing no one
      about, took the liberty to sit down at the table and eat. I am willing to
      pay for my dinner if you will tell me how much it amounts to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t my husband here?&rdquo; asked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am afraid something has happened to your husband,&rdquo; faltered
      Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl silently pointed to the chamber door. The woman opened it, and
      uttered a loud shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Walter!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion quickly came to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is dead!&rdquo; cried the woman; &ldquo;basely murdered, and there,&rdquo;
       pointing fiercely to Carl, &ldquo;there stands the murderer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you cannot believe this!&rdquo; said Carl, naturally agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo; demanded the man, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only just saw&mdash;your husband,&rdquo; continued Carl, addressing himself
      to the woman. &ldquo;I had finished my meal, when I began to search for some one
      whom I could pay, and so opened this door into the room beyond, when I saw&mdash;him
      hanging there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe him, the red-handed murderer!&rdquo; broke out the woman,
      fiercely. &ldquo;He is probably a thief; he killed my poor husband, and then sat
      down like a cold-blooded villain that he is, and gorged himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Things began to look very serious for poor Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband is larger and stronger than myself,&rdquo; he urged, desperately.
      &ldquo;How could I overpower him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks reasonable, Maria,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the boy could
      have killed Mr. Brown, or lifted him upon the hook, even if he did not
      resist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He murdered him, I tell you, he murdered him!&rdquo; shrieked the woman, who
      seemed bereft of reason. &ldquo;I call upon you to arrest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a constable, Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tie him so he cannot get away, and go for a constable. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      feel safe with him in the house, unless he were tied fast. He might hang
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terrible as the circumstances were, Carl felt an impulse to laugh. It
      seemed absurd to hear himself talked of in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie me if you like!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am willing to wait here till some one
      comes who has a little common sense. Just remember that I am only a boy,
      and haven&rsquo;t the strength of a full-grown man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy is right, Maria! It&rsquo;s a foolish idea of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call upon you to tie the villain!&rdquo; insisted the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say! Can you give me some rope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a drawer Mrs. Brown drew a quantity of strong cord, and the man
      proceeded to tie Carl&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie his feet, too, Walter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if you didn&rsquo;t tie me, I would promise to remain here. I don&rsquo;t want
      anybody to suspect me of such a thing,&rdquo; put in Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How artful he is!&rdquo; said Mrs. Brown. &ldquo;Tie him strong, Walter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were left alone, Carl feeling decidedly uncomfortable. The
      newly-made widow laid her head upon the table and moaned, glancing
      occasionally at the body of her husband, as it still hung suspended from
      the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, William, I little expected to find you dead!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;I only
      went to the store to buy a pound of salt, and when I come back, I find you
      cold and still, the victim of a young ruffian! How could you be so
      wicked?&rdquo; she demanded fiercely of Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you that I had nothing to do with your husband&rsquo;s death,
      madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who killed him, then?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He must have committed suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you are going to escape in that way. I won&rsquo;t rest till I see
      you hung!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had never entered the house,&rdquo; thought Carl, uncomfortably. &ldquo;I
      would rather have gone hungry for twenty four hours longer than find
      myself in such a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour passed. Then a sound of voices was heard outside, and half a
      dozen men entered, including besides the messenger, the constable and a
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was he not cut down?&rdquo; asked the doctor, hastily. &ldquo;There might have
      been a chance to resuscitate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; said the messenger. &ldquo;Maria was so excited, and
      insisted that the boy murdered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy? What nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Park. &ldquo;Why, it would be more than
      you or I could do to overpower and hang a man weighing one hundred and
      seventy-five pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, but Maria seemed crazed like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he did it! Are you going to let him go, the red-handed
      murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loose the cord, and I will question the boy,&rdquo; said Dr. Park, with an air
      of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl breathed a sigh of relief, when, freed from his bonds, he stood
      upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t throw any light upon
      the death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Park listened attentively, and asked one or two questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear any noise when you were sitting at the table?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the door closed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of itself would probably prevent your hearing anything. Mrs. Brown,
      at what hour did you leave the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ten minutes of twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now five minutes of one. The deed must have been committed just
      after you left the house. Had you noticed anything out of the way in your&mdash;husband&rsquo;s
      manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not much. He was always a silent man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had anything happened to disturb him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got a letter this morning. I don&rsquo;t know what was in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better search for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The body was taken down and laid on the bed. Dr. Park searched the
      pockets, and found a half sheet of note paper, on which these lines were
      written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria:&mdash;I have made up my mind I can ive no longer. I have made a
      terrible discovery. When I married you, I thought my first wife, who
      deserted me four years ago, dead. I learn by a letter received this
      morning that she is still living in a town of Illinois. The only thing I
      can do is to free you both from my presence. When you come back from the
      store you will find me cold and dead. The little that I leave behind I
      give to you. If my first wife should come here, as she threatens, you can
      tell her so. Good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reading of this letter made a sensation. Mrs. Brown went into
      hysterics, and there was a scene of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I can go?&rdquo; Carl asked Dr. Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There is nothing to connect you with the sad event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl gladly left the cottage, and it was only when he was a mile on his
      way that he remembered that he had not paid for his dinner, after all.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Three days later found Carl still on his travels. It was his custom to
      obtain his meals at a cheap hotel, or, if none were met with, at a
      farmhouse, and to secure lodgings where he could, and on as favorable
      terms as possible. He realized the need of economy, and felt that he was
      practicing it. He had changed his ten-dollar bill the first day, for a
      five and several ones. These last were now spent, and the five-dollar bill
      alone remained to him. He had earned nothing, though everywhere he had
      been on the lookout for a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of the last day he overtook a young man of twenty-five,
      who was traveling in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon,&rdquo; said the young man, sociably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you bound, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the next town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fillmore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if that is the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we travel together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; said Carl, who was glad of company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in any business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I hope to find a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a smart boy like you will soon find employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, I am sure. I haven&rsquo;t much money left, and it is necessary I
      should do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. I am a New York salesman, but just now I am on my vacation&mdash;taking
      a pedestrian tour with knapsack and staff, as you see. The beauty of it is
      that my salary runs on just as if I were at my post, and will nearly pay
      all my traveling expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in luck. Besides you have a good place to go back to. There isn&rsquo;t
      any vacancy, is there? You couldn&rsquo;t take on a boy?&rdquo; asked Carl, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there might be a chance,&rdquo; said the young man, slowly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
      any recommendations with you, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have never been employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I will recommend you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be deceived in me,&rdquo; said Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the risk of that. I know a reliable boy when I see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. What is the name of your firm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. Brandes &amp; Co., commission merchants, Pearl Street. My own name is
      Chauncy Hubbard, at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good name. I predict that we shall be great chums, if I manage
      to get you a place in our establishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Brandes a good man to work for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is easy and good-natured. He is liberal to his clerks. What
      salary do you think I get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty dollars a week, and I am only twenty-five. Went into the house at
      sixteen, and worked my way up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have certainly done well,&rdquo; said Carl, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m no slouch, if I do say it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder your income pays the expenses of your vacation trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to, that&rsquo;s a fact, though I&rsquo;m rather free handed and like to
      spend money. My prospects are pretty good in another direction. Old Fred
      Brandes has a handsome daughter, who thinks considerable of your humble
      servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there is any chance of marrying her?&rdquo; asked Carl, with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my chance is pretty good, as the girl won&rsquo;t look at anybody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Brandes wealthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the old man&rsquo;s pretty well fixed, worth nearly half a million, I
      guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will take you into the firm,&rdquo; suggested Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, you ought to save something out of your salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought, but I haven&rsquo;t. The fact is, Carl,&rdquo; said Chauncy Hubbard, in a
      burst of confidence, &ldquo;I have a great mind to make a confession to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall feel flattered, I am sure,&rdquo; said Carl, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one great fault&mdash;I gamble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Carl, rather startled, for he had been brought up very
      properly to have a horror of gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose it&rsquo;s in my blood. My father was a very rich man at one
      time, but he lost nearly all his fortune at the gaming table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to have been a warning to you, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought, and may be yet, for I am still a young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hubbard,&rdquo; said Carl, earnestly, &ldquo;I feel rather diffident about
      advising you, for I am only a boy, but I should think you would give up
      such a dangerous habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, Carl! You are a true friend. I will try to follow your
      advice. Give me your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl did so, and felt a warm glow of pleasure at the thought that perhaps
      he had redeemed his companion from a fascinating vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really wish I had a sensible boy like you to be my constant companion.
      I should feel safer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really have such a passion for gambling, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if at the hotel to-night I should see a party playing poker, I could
      not resist joining them. Odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I have no such temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are lucky. By the way, how much money have you about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can do me a favor. I have a ten-dollar bill, which I need to get
      me home. Now, I would like to have you keep a part of it for me till I go
      away in the morning. Give me your five, and I will hand you ten. Out of
      that you can pay my hotel bill and hand me the balance due me in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really wish me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said. Here is the ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl took the bill, and gave Mr. Hubbard his five-dollar note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are placing considerable confidence in me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, it is true, but I have no fear of being deceived. You are a boy who
      naturally inspires confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl thought Mr. Chauncy Hubbard a very agreeable and sensible fellow, and
      he felt flattered to think that the young man had chosen him as a
      guardian, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Carl, you haven&rsquo;t told me,&rdquo; said Hubbard, as they pursued
      their journey, &ldquo;how a boy like yourself is forced to work his own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you the reason very briefly&mdash;I have a stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. Is your father living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he thinks more of the stepmother than of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my sympathy, Carl. I will do all I can to help you. If you can
      only get a place in our establishment, you will be all right. Step by step
      you will rise, till you come to stand where I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would satisfy me. Has Mr. Brandes got another daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there is only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall have to be content with the forty dollars a week. If I ever
      get it, I will save half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can if you try. Why, you might have two thousand dollars saved up
      now, if you had only begun to save in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost more than that at the gaming table. You will think me very
      foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Carl, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. But here we are almost at the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a good hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the Fillmore. We will take adjoining rooms if you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the morning you will pay the bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two travelers had a good supper, and retired early, both being
      fatigued with the journey. It was not till eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning
      that Carl opened his eyes. He dressed hastily, and went down to breakfast.
      He was rather surprised not to see his companion of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Hubbard come down yet?&rdquo; he asked at the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he took an early breakfast, and went off by the first train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange. I was to pay his bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He paid it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl did not know what to make of this. Had Hubbard forgotten that he had
      five dollars belonging to him? Fortunately, Carl had his city address, and
      could refund the money in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! I will pay my own bill. How much is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dollar and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl took the ten-dollar bill from his wallet and tendered it to the
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of changing it at once, the clerk held it up to the light and
      examined it critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take that bill,&rdquo; he said, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is counterfeit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl turned pale, and the room seemed to whirl round. It was all the money
      he had.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COUNTERFEIT BILL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it is counterfeit?&rdquo; asked Carl, very much disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of it. I haven&rsquo;t been handling bank bills for ten years
      without being able to tell good money from bad. I&rsquo;ll trouble you for
      another bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the money I have,&rdquo; faltered Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young man,&rdquo; said the clerk, sternly, &ldquo;you are trying a bold
      game, but it won&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying no game at all,&rdquo; said Carl, plucking up spirit. &ldquo;I thought
      the bill was good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the man who came with me last evening&mdash;Mr. Hubbard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money he gave me was good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he give you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A five-dollar bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my five-dollar bill,&rdquo; said Carl, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story doesn&rsquo;t seem very probable,&rdquo; said the clerk, suspiciously.
      &ldquo;How did he happen to get your money, and you his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that he would get to gambling, and wished me to take money
      enough to pay his bill here. He handed me the ten-dollar bill which you
      say is bad, and I gave him five in return. I think now he only wanted to
      get good money for bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story may be true, or it may not,&rdquo; said the clerk, whose manner
      indicated incredulity. &ldquo;That is nothing to me. All you have to do is to
      pay your hotel bill, and you can settle with Mr. Hubbard when you see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no other money,&rdquo; said Carl, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall feel justified in ordering your arrest on a charge of
      passing, or trying to pass, counterfeit money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, sir! I will see that you are paid out of the first money I
      earn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think I am soft,&rdquo; said the clerk, contemptuously. &ldquo;I have seen
      persons of your stripe before. I dare say, if you were searched, more
      counterfeit money would be found in your pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me, then!&rdquo; cried Carl, indignantly. &ldquo;I am perfectly willing that
      you should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any relations who will pay your bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no one to call upon,&rdquo; answered Carl, soberly. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you let me
      work it out? I am ready to do any kind of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our list of workers is full,&rdquo; said the clerk, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Carl! he felt that he was decidedly in a tight place. He had never
      before found himself unable to meet his bills, nor would he have been so
      placed now but for Hubbard&rsquo;s rascality. A dollar and a quarter seems a
      small sum, but if you are absolutely penniless it might as well be a
      thousand. Suppose he should be arrested and the story get into the papers?
      How his stepmother would exult in the record of his disgrace! He could
      anticipate what she would say. Peter, too, would rejoice, and between them
      both his father would be persuaded that he was thoroughly unprincipled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got in your valise?&rdquo; asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only some underclothing. If there were anything of any value I would
      cheerfully leave it as security. Wait a minute, though,&rdquo; he said, with a
      sudden thought. &ldquo;Here is a gold pencil! It is worth five dollars; at any
      rate, it cost more than that. I can place that in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl handed the clerk a neat gold pencil, on which his name was inscribed.
      It was evidently of good quality, and found favor with the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar and a quarter for the pencil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and call
      it square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to sell it,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get any more for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that; but it was given me by my mother, who is now
      dead. I would not like to part with anything that she gave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would prefer to get off scot-free, I suppose?&rdquo; retorted the clerk,
      with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am willing to leave it in your hands, but I should like the
      privilege of redeeming it when I have the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the clerk, who reflected that in all probability Carl
      would never come back for it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it on those conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl passed over the pencil with a sigh. He didn&rsquo;t like to part with it,
      even for a short time, but there seemed no help for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I will mark you paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl left the hotel, satchel in hand, and as he passed out into the
      street, reflected with a sinking heart that he was now quite penniless.
      Where was he to get his dinner, and how was he to provide himself with a
      lodging that night? At present he was not hungry, having eaten a hearty
      breakfast at the hotel, but by one o&rsquo;clock he would feel the need of food.
      He began to ask himself if, after all, he had not been unwise in leaving
      home, no matter how badly he had been treated by his stepmother. There, at
      least, he was certain of living comfortably. Now he was in danger of
      starvation, and on two occasions already he had incurred suspicion, once
      of being concerned in a murder, and just now of passing counterfeit money.
      Ought he to have submitted, and so avoided all these perils?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he finally decided; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give up the ship yet. I am about as
      badly off as I can be; I am without a cent, and don&rsquo;t know where my next
      meal is to come from. But my luck may turn&mdash;it must turn&mdash;it has
      turned!&rdquo; he exclaimed with energy, as his wandering glance suddenly fell
      upon a silver quarter of a dollar, nearly covered up with the dust of the
      street. &ldquo;That shall prove a good omen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over and picked up the coin, which he put in his vest pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wonderful how the possession of this small sum of money restored
      his courage and raised his spirits. He was sure of a dinner now, at all
      events. It looked as if Providence was smiling on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two miles farther on Carl overtook a boy of about his own age trudging
      along the road with a rake over his shoulder. He wore overalls, and was
      evidently a farmer&rsquo;s boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; said Carl, pleasantly, noticing that the boy regarded him with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; returned the country lad, rather bashfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me if there is any place near where I can buy some dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no tavern, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home to dinner
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a farmhouse about a dozen rods away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think your mother would give me some dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she would. Mam&rsquo;s real accommodatin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; just come along of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned into the yard, and followed a narrow path to the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here while you ask,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy entered the house, and came out after a brief absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mam says you&rsquo;re to come in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl, glad at heart, and feeling quite prepared to eat fifty cents&rsquo; worth
      of dinner, followed the boy inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant-looking, matronly woman, plainly but neatly attired, came
      forward to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat says you would like to get some dinner,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Carl. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse my applying to you, but your
      son tells me there is no hotel near by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nearest one is three miles away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can hold out so long,&rdquo; said Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit right down with Nat,&rdquo; said the farmer&rsquo;s wife, hospitably. &ldquo;Mr.
      Sweetser won&rsquo;t be home for half an hour. We&rsquo;ve got enough, such as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Mrs. Sweetser was a good cook. The dinner consisted of boiled
      mutton, with several kinds of vegetables. A cup of tea and two kinds of
      pie followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to tell which of the two boys did fuller justice to the meal.
      Nat had the usual appetite of a healthy farm boy, and Carl, in spite of
      his recent anxieties, and narrow escape from serious peril, did not allow
      himself to fall behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s a fine cook!&rdquo; said Carl, between two mouthfuls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she, though?&rdquo; answered Nat, his mouth full of pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carl rose from the table he feared that he had eaten more than his
      little stock of money would pay for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will it be, Mrs. Sweetser?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re quite welcome to all you&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; said the good woman,
      cheerily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain farmer&rsquo;s fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never tasted a better dinner,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sweetser seemed pleased with the compliment to her cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again when you are passing this way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will always be
      welcome to a dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl thanked her heartily, and pressed on his way. Two hours later, at a
      lonely point of the road, an ill-looking tramp, who had been reclining by
      the wayside, jumped up, and addressed him in a menacing tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young feller, shell over all the money you have got, or I&rsquo;ll hurt you!
      I&rsquo;m hard up, and I won&rsquo;t stand no nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl started and looked into the face of the tramp. It seemed to him that
      he had never seen a man more ill-favored, or villainous-looking.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ARCHERY PRIZE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Situated as he was, it seemed, on second thought, rather a joke to Carl to
      be attacked by a robber. He had but twenty-five cents in good money about
      him, and that he had just picked up by the merest chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look like a banker?&rdquo; he asked, humorously. &ldquo;Why do you want to rob a
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way you&rsquo;re togged out, you must have something,&rdquo; growled the tramp,
      &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t got a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business doesn&rsquo;t seem to pay, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make fun of me, or I&rsquo;ll wring your neck! Just hand over your
      money and be quick about it! I haven&rsquo;t time to stand fooling here all
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bright idea came to Carl. He couldn&rsquo;t spare the silver coin, which
      constituted all his available wealth, but he still had the counterfeit
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take all my money, will you?&rdquo; he said, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you got?&rdquo; asked the tramp, pricking up his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl, with apparent reluctance, drew out the ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp&rsquo;s face lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your name Vanderbilt?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to make such a
      haul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me back a dollar out of it? I don&rsquo;t want to lose all I
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a cent. You&rsquo;ll have to wait till we meet again. So long,
      boy! You&rsquo;ve helped me out of a scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or into one,&rdquo; thought Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp straightened up, buttoned his dilapidated coat, and walked off
      with the consciousness of being a capitalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl watched him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I won&rsquo;t meet him after he has discovered that the bill is a
      counterfeit,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He congratulated himself upon being still the possessor of twenty-five
      cents in silver. It was not much, but it seemed a great deal better than
      being penniless. A week before he would have thought it impossible that
      such a paltry sum would have made him feel comfortable, but he had passed
      through a great deal since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of the afternoon he came to a field, in which something
      appeared to be going on. Some forty or fifty young persons, boys and
      girls, were walking about the grass, and seemed to be preparing for some
      interesting event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl stopped to rest and look on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; he asked of a boy who was sitting on the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a meeting of the athletic association,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They try for prizes in jumping, vaulting, archery and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This interested Carl, who excelled in all manly exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I may stay and look on?&rdquo; he said, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. Jump over the fence and I&rsquo;ll go round with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed pleasant to Carl to associate once more with boys of his own
      age. Thrown unexpectedly upon his own resources, he had almost forgotten
      that he was a boy. Face to face with a cold and unsympathizing world, he
      seemed to himself twenty-five at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who wish to compete for the archery prize will come forward,&rdquo;
       announced Robert Gardiner, a young man of nineteen, who, as Carl learned,
      was the president of the association. &ldquo;You all understand the conditions.
      The entry fee to competitors is ten cents. The prize to the most
      successful archer is one dollar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several boys came forward and paid the entrance fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to compete?&rdquo; asked Edward Downie, the boy whose
      acquaintance Carl had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an outsider,&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to the association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to the president, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to intrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be considered an intrusion. You pay the entrance fee and take
      your chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward went to the president and spoke to him in a low voice. The result
      was that he advanced to Carl, and said, courteously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would like to enter into our games, you are quite at liberty to do
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Carl. &ldquo;I have had a little practice in archery, and
      will enter my name for that prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paid over his quarter and received back fifteen cents in change. It
      seemed rather an imprudent outlay, considering his small capital; but he
      had good hopes of carrying off the prize, and that would be a great lift
      for him. Seven boys entered besides Carl. The first was Victor Russell, a
      lad of fourteen, whose arrow went three feet above the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prize is mine if none of you do better than that,&rdquo; laughed Victor,
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, for the credit of the club,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Mr.
      Crawford, will you shoot next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would prefer to be the last,&rdquo; said Carl, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Livermore, your turn now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John came a little nearer than his predecessor, but did not distinguish
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is a specimen of the skill of the clubmen,&rdquo; thought Carl, &ldquo;my
      chance is a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next came Frank Stockton, whose arrow stuck only three inches from the
      center of the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for Fred!&rdquo; cried Edward Downie. &ldquo;Just wait till you see me shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a dangerous rival?&rdquo; asked Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hit a barn door if I am only near enough,&rdquo; replied Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Downie!&rdquo; called the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward took his bow and advanced to the proper place, bent it, and the
      arrow sped on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of surprise when his arrow struck only an inch to the
      right of the centre. No one was more amazed than Edward himself, for he
      was accounted far from skillful. It was indeed a lucky accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo; asked Edward, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the prize is yours. I had no idea you could shoot like that,&rdquo;
       said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; rejoined Edward, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl Crawford!&rdquo; called the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl took his position, and bent his bow with the greatest care. He
      exercised unusual deliberation, for success meant more to him than to any
      of the others. A dollar to him in his present circumstances would be a
      small fortune, while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly felt.
      His heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on its
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      His unusual deliberation, and the fact that he was a stranger, excited
      strong interest, and all eyes followed the arrow with eager attentiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden shout of irrepressible excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl&rsquo;s arrow had struck the bull&rsquo;s-eye and the prize was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; exclaimed Edward Downie, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve beaten me, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sorry,&rdquo; said Carl, apologetically, but the light in his eyes
      hardly bore out the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Everybody would have called it a fluke if I had won,&rdquo; said
      Edward. &ldquo;I expect to get the prize for the long jump. I am good at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, but I won&rsquo;t compete; I will leave it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I want to win fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl accordingly entered his name. He made the second best jump, but
      Edward&rsquo;s exceeded his by a couple of inches, and the prize was adjudged to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my revenge,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I am glad I won, for it wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been to the credit of the club to have an outsider carry off two
      prizes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; said Carl; &ldquo;I ought to be, for I did not
      expect to carry off any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl decided not to compete for any other prize. He had invested twenty
      cents and got back a dollar, which left him a profit of eighty cents.
      This, with his original quarter, made him the possessor of a dollar and
      five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My luck seems to have turned,&rdquo; he said to himself, and the thought gave
      him fresh courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o&rsquo;clock when the games were over, and Carl prepared to start
      again on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take supper?&rdquo; asked Downie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home with me. If you are in no hurry, you may as well stay
      overnight, and go on in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it won&rsquo;t inconvenience you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll accept with thanks.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ODD ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      After breakfast the next morning Carl started again on his way. His new
      friend, Edward Downie, accompanied him for a mile, having an errand at
      that distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you good luck, Carl,&rdquo; he said, earnestly. &ldquo;When you come this way
      again, be sure to stop in and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will certainly do so, but I hope I may find employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; thought Carl, as he resumed his journey alone, &ldquo;I am better
      off than I was yesterday morning. Then I had but twenty-five cents; now I
      have a dollar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was satisfactory as far as it went, but Carl was sensible that he was
      making no progress in his plan of earning a living. He was simply living
      from hand to mouth, and but for good luck he would have had to go hungry,
      and perhaps have been obliged to sleep out doors. What he wanted was
      employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten o&rsquo;clock when, looking along the road, his curiosity was
      excited by a man of very unusual figure a few rods in advance of him. He
      looked no taller than a boy of ten; but his frame was large, his shoulders
      broad, and his arms were of unusual length. He might properly be called a
      dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I am not so small as that,&rdquo; thought Carl. &ldquo;I am richer than he
      in having a good figure. I should not like to excite attention wherever I
      go by being unusually large or unusually small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some boys would have felt inclined to laugh at the queer figure, but Carl
      had too much good feeling. His curiosity certainly was aroused, and he
      thought he would like to get acquainted with the little man, whose
      garments of fine texture showed that, though short in stature, he was
      probably long in purse. He didn&rsquo;t quite know how to pave the way for an
      acquaintance, but circumstances favored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man drew out a handkerchief from the side pocket of his
      overcoat. With it fluttered out a bank bill, which fell to the ground
      apparently unobserved by the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl hurried on, and, picking up the bill, said to the small stranger as
      he touched his arm: &ldquo;Here is some money you just dropped, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man turned round and smiled pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Are you sure it is mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; it came out with your handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see. So it is mine. I was very careless to put it loose in my
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were rather careless, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what denomination is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a two-dollar note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had been a poor boy,&rdquo; said the little man, eying Carl keenly, &ldquo;you
      might have been tempted to keep it. I might not have known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I am not a poor boy?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are well dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; but all the money I have is a dollar and five cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where to get more? You have a good home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a home, but now I am thrown on my own exertions,&rdquo; said Carl,
      soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! That is bad! If I were better acquainted, I might ask more
      particularly how this happens. Are you an orphan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; my father is living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your mother is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your father a poor man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he is moderately rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you have to fight your own way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I have a stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Are you sure you are not unreasonably prejudiced against your
      stepmother? All stepmothers are not bad or unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours is, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl recited some incidents in his experience with his stepmother. The
      stranger listened with evident interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in general in favor of boys leaving home except on extreme
      provocation,&rdquo; he said, after a pause; &ldquo;but in your case, as your father
      seems to take part against you, I think you may be justified, especially
      as, at your age, you have a fair chance of making your own living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think that, sir. I have begun to wonder whether I have not
      acted rashly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In undertaking to support yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At fourteen I was obliged to undertake what you have now before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To support yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was left an orphan at fourteen, with no money left me by my poor
      father, and no relatives who could help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you make out, sir?&rdquo; asked Carl, feeling very much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sold papers for a while&mdash;in Newark, New Jersey&mdash;then I got a
      place at three dollars a week, out of which I had to pay for board,
      lodging and clothes. Well, I won&rsquo;t go through my history. I will only say
      that whatever I did I did as well as I could. I am now a man of about
      middle age, and I am moderately wealthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much encouraged by what you tell me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t understand what a hard struggle I had. More than once I
      have had to go to bed hungry. Sometimes I have had to sleep out, but one
      mustn&rsquo;t be afraid to rough it a little when he is young. I shouldn&rsquo;t like
      to sleep out now, or go to bed without my supper,&rdquo; and the little man
      laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I expect to rough it, but if I could only get a situation, at
      no matter what income, I should feel encouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have earned no money yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I earned a dollar yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what kind of work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a business?&rdquo; he asked, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain how it was,&rdquo; and Carl told about the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you hit the mark?&rdquo; said the little man, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, there was something in the little man&rsquo;s tone that put new courage
      into Carl, and incited him to fresh effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, sir,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;that you should be walking, when
      you can well afford to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is by advice of my physician,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He tells me I am getting too
      stout, and ought to take more or less exercise in the open air. So I am
      trying to follow his advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in business near here, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a large town six miles distant. I may not walk all the way there, but
      I have a place to call at near by, and thought I would avail myself of the
      good chance offered to take a little exercise. I feel repaid. I have made
      a pleasant acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my card,&rdquo; and the little man took out a business card, reading
      thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      HENRY JENNINGS, FURNITURE WAREHOUSE, MILFORD.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I manufacture my furniture in the country,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but I ship it
      by special arrangements to a house in New York in which I am also
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I see. Do you employ many persons in your establishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could make room for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you would like the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared to like any business in which I can make a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. That is the way to look at it. Let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two minutes Mr. Jennings seemed to be plunged in thought. Then he
      turned and smiled encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come home with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will consider the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Carl, gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got to make a call at the next house, not on business, though.
      There is an old schoolmate lying there sick. I am afraid he is rather
      poor, too. You can walk on slowly, and I will overtake you in a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After walking half a mile, if I have not overtaken you, you may sit down
      under a tree and wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I leave you I will tell you a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two dollars you picked up, I dropped on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo; asked Carl, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I wanted to try you, to see if you were honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had noticed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I liked your appearance, but I wanted to test you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN UNEQUAL CONTEST.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl walked on slowly. He felt encouraged by the prospect of work, for he
      was sure that Mr. Jennings would make a place for him, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is evidently a kind-hearted man,&rdquo; Carl reflected. &ldquo;Besides, he has
      been poor himself, and he can sympathize with me. The wages may be small,
      but I won&rsquo;t mind that, if I only support myself economically, and get on.&rdquo;
       To most boys brought up in comfort, not to say luxury, the prospect of
      working hard for small pay would not have seemed inviting. But Carl was
      essentially manly, and had sensible ideas about labor. It was no sacrifice
      or humiliation to him to become a working boy, for he had never considered
      himself superior to working boys, as many boys in his position would have
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on in a leisurely manner, and at the end of ten minutes thought
      he had better sit down and wait for Mr. Jennings. But he was destined to
      receive a shock. There, under the tree which seemed to offer the most
      inviting shelter, reclined a figure only too well-known.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the tramp who the day before had compelled him to surrender the
      ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-looking fellow glanced up, and when his gaze rested upon Carl, his
      face beamed with savage joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; he said, rising from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Carl, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have cause to remember you, my chicken. That was a mean trick you
      played upon me,&rdquo; and he nodded his head significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was you that played the trick on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; growled the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did, and much good it did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl might have denied that he knew the character of the bill which was
      stolen from him, but I am glad to say that it would have come from him
      with a very ill grace, for he was accustomed to tell the truth under all
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew that the bill was counterfeit, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded the tramp,
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told so at the hotel where I offered it in payment for my bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you passed it on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pass it on you. You took it from me,&rdquo; retorted Carl, with
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes no difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it does. I wouldn&rsquo;t have offered it to anyone in payment of an
      honest bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! you thought because I was poor and unfortunate you could pass it
      off on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed so grotesque that Carl found it difficult not to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know it nearly got me into trouble?&rdquo; went on the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped at a baker&rsquo;s shop to get a lunch. When I got through I offered
      the bill. The old Dutchman put on his spectacles, and he looked first at
      the bill, then at me. Then he threatened to have me arrested for passing
      bad money. I told him I&rsquo;d go out in the back yard and settle it with him.
      I tell you, boy, I&rsquo;d have knocked him out in one round, and he knew it, so
      he bade me be gone and never darken his door again. Where did you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was passed on me by a man I was traveling with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much other money have you got?&rdquo; asked the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a little too much for Carl&rsquo;s patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money to spare,&rdquo; he said, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that over again!&rdquo; said the tramp, menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand me, I will. I have no money to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spare it to me, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Carl, slowly backing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve robbed me of ten dollars.
      You&rsquo;ll have to be satisfied with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no good. It might have sent me to prison. If I was nicely dressed
      I might pass it, but when a chap like me offers a ten-dollar bill it&rsquo;s
      sure to be looked at sharply. I haven&rsquo;t a cent, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you to
      hand over all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you work for a living? You are a strong, able-bodied man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find I am if you give me any more of your palaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl saw that the time of negotiation was past, and that active
      hostilities were about to commence. Accordingly he turned and ran, not
      forward, but in the reverse direction, hoping in this way to meet with Mr.
      Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s your game, is it?&rdquo; growled the tramp. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t expect to
      escape, for I&rsquo;ll overhaul you in two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Carl ran, and his rough acquaintance ran after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could hardly be expected that a boy of sixteen, though stout and
      strong, could get away from a tall, powerful man like the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back over his shoulder, Carl saw that the tramp was but three feet
      behind, and almost able to lay his hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dodged dexterously, and in trying to do the same the tramp nearly fell
      to the ground. Naturally, this did not sweeten his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll half murder you when I get hold of you,&rdquo; he growled, in a tone that
      bodied ill for Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter began to pant, and felt that he could not hold out much longer.
      Should he surrender at discretion?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If some one would only come along,&rdquo; was his inward aspiration. &ldquo;This man
      will take my money and beat me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in reply to his fervent prayer the small figure of Mr. Jennings
      appeared suddenly, rounding a curve in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, save me, Mr. Jennings!&rdquo; cried Carl, running up to the little man
      for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? Who is this fellow?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings, in a deep
      voice for so small a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tramp wants to rob me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself! He won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Jennings, calmly.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL ARRIVES IN MILFORD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The tramp stopped short, and eyed Carl&rsquo;s small defender, first with
      curious surprise, and then with derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of my way, you midget!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or &lsquo;ll hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it!&rdquo; said the little man, showing no sign of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re no bigger than a kid. I can upset you with one finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced contemptuously, and laid his hand on the shoulder of the
      dwarf. In an instant Jennings had swung his flail-like arms, and before
      the tramp understood what was happening he was lying flat on his back, as
      much to Carl&rsquo;s amazement as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped to his feet with an execration, and advanced again to the
      attack. To be upset by such a pigmy was the height of mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to crush you, you mannikin!&rdquo; he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jennings put himself on guard. Like many small men, he was very powerful,
      as his broad shoulders and sinewy arms would have made evident to a
      teacher of gymnastics. He clearly understood that this opponent was in
      deadly earnest, and he put out all the strength which he possessed. The
      result was that his large-framed antagonist went down once more, striking
      his head with a force that nearly stunned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that at this juncture reinforcements arrived. A sheriff and
      his deputy drove up in an open buggy, and, on witnessing the encounter,
      halted their carriage and sprang to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Jennings?&rdquo; asked the sheriff, respectfully, for
      the little man was a person of importance in that vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gentleman is trying to extort a forced loan, Mr. Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! a footpad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff sprang to the side of the tramp, who was trying to rise, and
      in a trice his wrists were confined by handcuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know you, Mike Frost,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are up to your old tricks.
      When did you come out of Sing Sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks since,&rdquo; answered the tramp, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want you back there. Come along with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was assisted into the buggy, and spent that night in the lockup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he take anything from you, Carl?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; but I was in considerable danger. How strong you are!&rdquo; he added,
      admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strength isn&rsquo;t always according to size!&rdquo; said the little man, quietly.
      &ldquo;Nature gave me a powerful, though small, frame, and I have increased my
      strength by gymnastic exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings did not show the least excitement after his desperate
      contest. He had attended to it as a matter of business, and when over he
      suffered it to pass out of his mind. He took out his watch and noted the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is later than I thought,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I shall have to give up my
      plan of walking the rest of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be left alone,&rdquo; thought Carl regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a man overtook them in a carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted Mr. Jennings respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you out for a long walk?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I find time is passing too rapidly with me. Are you going to
      Milford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you take two passengers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; of course I will see that you don&rsquo;t lose by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not to charge you anything, Mr. Jennings. Several times you have
      done me favors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope to again, but this is business. If a dollar will pay you, the
      boy and I will ride with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be so much gain, as I don&rsquo;t go out of my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take the back seat, Carl,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;I will sit with
      Mr. Leach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were soon seated and on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relative of yours, Mr. Jennings?&rdquo; asked Leach, with a backward glance at
      Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most country folks, he was curious about people. Those who live in
      cities meet too many of their kind to feel an interest in strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a young friend,&rdquo; answered Jennings, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to visit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he will stay with me for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the conversation touched upon Milford matters in which at present
      Carl was not interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his fatiguing walk our hero enjoyed the sensation of riding. The
      road was a pleasant one, the day was bright with sunshine and the air
      vocal with the songs of birds. For a time houses were met at rare
      intervals, but after a while it became evident that they were approaching
      a town of considerable size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Milford, Mr. Jennings?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the little man, turning with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How large is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there are twelve thousand inhabitants. It is what Western people
      call a &lsquo;right smart place.&rsquo; It has been my home for twenty years, and I am
      much attached to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it to you, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; put in the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is pleasant to hear,&rdquo; said Jennings, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. There are few people here whom you have not befriended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we are here for, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish all were of your opinion. Why, Mr. Jennings, when we get a city
      charter I think I know who will be the first mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, Mr. Leach. My own business is all I can well attend to. Thank you
      for your compliment, though. Carl, do you see yonder building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a three-story structure, a frame building, occupying a
      prominent position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my manufactory. What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think a town of this size would require so large an
      establishment,&rdquo; answered Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I depended on Milford trade, a very small
      building would be sufficient. My trade is outside. I supply many dealers
      in New York City and at the West. My retail trade is small. If any of my
      neighbors want furniture they naturally come to me, and I favor them as to
      price out of friendly feeling, but I am a manufacturer and wholesale
      dealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I take you to your house, Mr. Jennings?&rdquo; asked Leach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leach drove on till he reached a two-story building of Quaker-like
      simplicity but with a large, pleasant yard in front, with here and there a
      bed of flowers. Here he stopped his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have reached our destination, Carl,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;You are
      active. Jump out and I will follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl needed no second invitation. He sprang from the carriage and went
      forward to help Mr. Jennings out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Carl,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;I am more active than you
      think. Here we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended nimbly to the ground, and, drawing a one-dollar bill from his
      pocket, handed it to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to take it, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; said Mr. Leach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? The laborer is worthy of his hire. Now, Carl, let us go into the
      house.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Mr. JENNINGS AT HOME.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings did not need to open the door. He had scarcely set foot on
      the front step when it was opened from inside, and Carl found a fresh
      surprise in store for him. A woman, apparently six feet in height, stood
      on the threshold. Her figure was spare and ungainly, and her face
      singularly homely, but the absence of beauty was partially made up by a
      kindly expression. She looked with some surprise at Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a young friend of mine, Hannah,&rdquo; said her master. &ldquo;Welcome him
      for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you,&rdquo; said Hannah, in a voice that was another
      amazement. It was deeper than that of most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she held out a large masculine hand, which Carl took, as
      seemed to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to call you?&rdquo; asked Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not common, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two will get acquainted by and by,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;The most
      interesting question at present is, when will dinner be ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten minutes,&rdquo; answered Hannah, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl and I are both famished. We have had considerable exercise,&rdquo; here he
      nodded at Carl with a comical look, and Carl understood that he referred
      in part to his contest with the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah disappeared into the kitchen, and Mr. Jennings said: &ldquo;Come
      upstairs, Carl. I will show you your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up an old-fashioned stairway Carl followed his host, and the latter opened
      the door of a side room on the first landing. It was not large, but was
      neat and comfortable. There was a cottage bedstead, a washstand, a small
      bureau and a couple of chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will come to feel at home here,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. I am sure I shall,&rdquo; Carl responded, gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some nails to hang your clothing on,&rdquo; went on Mr. Jennings, and
      then he stopped short, for it was clear that Carl&rsquo;s small gripsack could
      not contain an extra suit, and he felt delicate at calling up in the boy&rsquo;s
      mind the thought of his poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;I left my trunk at the house of a friend,
      and if you should succeed in finding me a place, I will send for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well!&rdquo; returned Mr. Jennings, looking relieved. &ldquo;Now I will leave
      you for a few moments. You will find water and towels, in case you wish to
      wash before dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was glad of the opportunity. He was particular about his personal
      appearance, and he felt hot and dusty. He bathed his face and hands,
      carefully dusted his suit, brushed his hair, and was ready to descend when
      he heard the tinkling of a small bell at the foot of the front stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He readily found his way into the neat dining-room at the rear of the
      parlor. Mr. Jennings sat at the head of the table, a little giant,
      diminutive in stature, but with broad shoulders, a large head, and a
      powerful frame. Opposite him sat Hannah, tall, stiff and upright as a
      grenadier. She formed a strange contrast to her employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what made him hire such a tall woman?&rdquo; thought Carl. &ldquo;Being so
      small himself, her size makes him look smaller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a chair at one side, placed for Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down there, Carl,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you waiting any
      longer than I can help. What have you given us to-day, Hannah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roast beef,&rdquo; answered Hannah in her deep tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The host cut off a liberal slice for Carl, and passed the plate to Hannah,
      who supplied potatoes, peas and squash. Carl&rsquo;s mouth fairly watered as he
      watched the hospitable preparations for his refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never trouble myself about what we are to have on the table,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Jennings. &ldquo;Hannah always sees to that. She&rsquo;s knows just what I want. She
      is a capital cook, too, Hannah is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannah looked pleased at this compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are easily pleased, master,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be hard to suit if I were not pleased with your cooking. You
      don&rsquo;t know so well Carl&rsquo;s taste, but if there is anything he likes
      particularly he can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, sir,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not many men who would treat a poor boy so considerately,&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;He makes me an honored guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over, Mr. Jennings invited Carl to accompany him on a
      walk. They passed along the principal street, nearly every person they met
      giving the little man a cordial greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be very popular,&rdquo; thought Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached the manufactory. Mr. Jennings went into the office,
      followed by Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slender, dark-complexioned man, about thirty-five years of age, sat on a
      stool at a high desk. He was evidently the bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters, Mr. Gibbon?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; here are four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From New York, Chicago, Pittsburg and New Haven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they relate to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders. I have handed them to Mr. Potter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Potter, as Carl afterwards learned, was superintendent of the manufactory,
      and had full charge of practical details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything requiring my personal attention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Gibbon, let me introduce you to a young friend of mine&mdash;Carl
      Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper rapidly scanned Carl&rsquo;s face and figure. It seemed to Carl
      that the scrutiny was not a friendly one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbon, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; said the bookkeeper, &ldquo;I have a favor to ask of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Gibbon,&rdquo; rejoined his employer, in a cordial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two months since you gave my nephew, Leonard Craig, a place in the
      factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the work agrees with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed a strong, healthy boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never been used to confinement, and it affects him unpleasantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he wish to resign his place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wondering whether you would not be willing to transfer him to
      the office. I could send him on errands, to the post office, and make him
      useful in various ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not supposed an office boy was needed. Still, if you desire it, I
      will try your nephew in the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bound to tell you, however, that his present place is a better one.
      He is learning a good trade, which, if he masters it, will always give him
      a livelihood. I learned a trade, and owe all I have to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Mr. Jennings, but there are other ways of earning a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought of giving Leonard evening instruction in bookkeeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case. Good bookkeepers are always in demand. I have no
      objection to your trying the experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you mentioned the matter to your nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just suggested that I would ask you, but could not say what answer you
      would give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better not to mention the matter at all till you could
      tell him definitely that he could change his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you are right, sir. However, it is all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Carl,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings, &ldquo;I will take you into the workroom.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL GETS A PLACE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is the bookkeeper,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He has been with me three years. He understands his business well.
      You heard what he said about his nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his sister&rsquo;s son&mdash;a boy of about your own age. I think he is
      making a mistake in leaving the factory, and going into the office. He
      will have little to do, and that not of a character to give him knowledge
      of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if he takes lessons in bookkeeping&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy will never make a bookkeeper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His reason for desiring
      the change is because he is indolent. The world has no room for lazy
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, sir, that you have had a chance to find him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little things betray a boy&rsquo;s nature, or a man&rsquo;s, for that matter. When I
      have visited the workroom I have noticed Leonard, and formed my
      conclusions. He is not a boy whom I would select for my service, but I
      have taken him as a favor to his uncle. I presume he is without means, and
      it is desirable that he should pay his uncle something in return for the
      home which he gives him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you pay him, sir, if it is not a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; he receives five dollars a week to begin with. I will pay him the
      same in the office. And that reminds me; how would you like to have a
      situation in the factory? Would you like to take Leonard&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, if you think I would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel quite sure of it. Have you ever done any manual labor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have always been to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a gentleman&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; proceeded Mr. Jennings, eying Carl
      attentively. &ldquo;How will it suit you to become a working boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall like it,&rdquo; answered Carl, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure! You can tell better after a week in the factory. Those
      in my employ work ten hours a day. Leonard Craig doesn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask, Mr. Jennings, is that you give me a trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is fair,&rdquo; responded the little man, looking pleased. &ldquo;I will tell
      you now that, not knowing of any vacancy in the factory, I had intended to
      give you the place in the office which Mr. Gibbon has asked for his
      nephew. It would have been a good deal easier work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be quite satisfied to take my place in the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, then, and see your future scene of employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered a large room, occupying nearly an entire floor of the
      building. Part of the space was filled by machinery. The number employed
      Carl estimated roughly at twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite near the door was a boy, who bore some personal resemblance to the
      bookkeeper. Carl concluded that it must be Leonard Craig. The boy looked
      round as Mr. Jennings entered, and eyed Carl sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you getting on, Leonard?&rdquo; Mr. Jennings asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, sir; but the machinery makes my head ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle tells me that your employment does not agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I don&rsquo;t think it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would like to have you in the office with him. Would you like it,
      also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Leonard, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You may report for duty at the office to-morrow morning. This
      boy will take your place here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard eyed Carl curiously, not cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two boys must get acquainted,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;Leonard, this is
      Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to know you,&rdquo; said Leonard, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall like that boy,&rdquo; thought Carl, as he followed Mr.
      Jennings to another part of the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL ENTERS THE FACTORY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When they left the factory Mr. Jennings said, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are one of us, Carl. To-morrow you begin work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask what salary you are to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to leave that to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we say two dollars a week and board&mdash;to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better than I expected. But where am I to board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my house, for the present, if that will suit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall like it very much, if it won&rsquo;t inconvenience you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannah is the one to be inconvenienced, if anyone. I had a little
      conversation with her while you were getting ready for dinner. She seems
      to have taken a liking for you, though she doesn&rsquo;t like boys generally. As
      for me, it will make the home brighter to have a young person in it.
      Hannah and I are old-fashioned and quiet, and the neighbors don&rsquo;t have
      much reason to complain of noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I should think not,&rdquo; said Carl, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing you must be prepared for, Carl,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your living in my house&mdash;I being your employer&mdash;may excite
      jealousy in some. I think I know of one who will be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Craig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his uncle. However, don&rsquo;t borrow any trouble on that score. I hope
      you won&rsquo;t take advantage of your position, and, thinking yourself a
      favorite, neglect your duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business and friendship ought to be kept apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going back to the house, but you may like to take a walk about the
      village. You will feel interested in it, as it is to be your future home.
      By the way, it may be well for you to write for your trunk. You can order
      it sent to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir; I will do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the post office, and, buying a postal card, wrote to his
      friend, Gilbert Vance, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Gilbert:&mdash;Please send my trunk by express to me at Milford,
      care of Henry Jennings, Esq. He is my employer, and I live at his house.
      He is proprietor of a furniture factory. Will write further particulars
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This postal carried welcome intelligence to Gilbert, who felt a brotherly
      interest in Carl. He responded by a letter of hearty congratulation, and
      forwarded the trunk as requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl reported for duty the next morning, and, though a novice, soon showed
      that he was not without mechanical skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock all the factory hands had an hour off for dinner. As
      Carl passed into the street he found himself walking beside the boy whom
      he had succeeded&mdash;Leonard Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Leonard,&rdquo; said Carl, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning. Have you taken my place in the factory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you shall like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall, though, of course, it is rather early to form an
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to grow up a workman. I think I am fit for something
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jennings began as a factory hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he had a taste for it. I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you like your present position better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s more genteel. How much does Jennings pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars a week and board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that? Where do you board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Leonard, his countenance changing. &ldquo;So you are a favorite with
      the boss, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He gave me warning that he should be just as strict with me
      as if we were strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you known him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him for the first time yesterday,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it is a little singular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a poor boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to earn my own living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. You will grow up a common workman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to rise above it. I am not ashamed of the position, but I am
      ambitious to rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be a bookkeeper,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;My uncle is going to teach
      me. I would rather be a bookkeeper than a factory hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are right in preparing yourself for such a post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the two boys separated, as they were to dine in different places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was pleased with his new position. He really had very little to
      do. Twice a day he went to the post office, once or twice to the bank, and
      there was an occasional errand besides. To Carl the idleness would have
      been insupportable, but Leonard was naturally indolent. He sat down in a
      chair by the window, and watched the people go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first afternoon he was in luck, for there was a dog fight in the
      street outside. He seized his hat, went out, and watched the canine
      warfare with the deepest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will buy you a system of bookkeeping,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;and you
      can study it in the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it off till next week, Uncle Julius. I want to get rested from the
      factory work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, Leonard, you were born lazy,&rdquo; said his uncle, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to work with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care to work at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be a bookkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that my work is harder and more exhausting than that of a
      workman in the factory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to exchange with him, do you?&rdquo; asked Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings took several weekly papers. Leonard was looking over the
      columns of one of them one day, when he saw the advertisement of a gift
      enterprise of a most attractive character. The first prize was a house and
      grounds valued at ten thousand dollars. Following were minor prizes, among
      them one thousand dollars in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard&rsquo;s fancy was captivated by the brilliant prospect of such a prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price of tickets&mdash;only one dollar!&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;Think of getting a
      thousand dollars for one! Oh, if I could only be the lucky one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his purse, though he knew beforehand that his stock of cash
      consisted only of two dimes and a nickel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I could borrow a dollar of that boy Carl!&rdquo; he deliberated.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to him about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This happened more than a week after Carl went to work in the factory. He
      had already received one week&rsquo;s pay, and it remained untouched in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard joined him in the street early in the evening, and accosted him
      graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere in particular. I am out for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Shall we walk together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After talking on indifferent matters, Leonard said suddenly: &ldquo;Oh, by the
      way, will you do me a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me a dollar till next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In former days Carl would probably have granted the favor, but he realized
      the value of money now that he had to earn it by steady work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it won&rsquo;t be convenient,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that mean that you haven&rsquo;t got it?&rdquo; asked Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have it, but I am expecting to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying you interest for it&mdash;say twenty-five cents,&rdquo;
       continued Leonard, who had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be ashamed to take such interest as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have a chance of making a good deal more out of it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you borrow it of your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would ask too many questions. However, I see that you&rsquo;re a miser, and
      I won&rsquo;t trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left Carl in a huff and walked hastily away. He turned into a lane
      little traveled, and, after walking a few rods, came suddenly upon the
      prostrate body of a man, whose deep, breathing showed that he was
      stupefied by liquor. Leonard was not likely to feel any special interest
      in him, but one object did attract his attention. It was a wallet which
      had dropped out of the man&rsquo;s pocket and was lying on the grass beside him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LEONARD&rsquo;S TEMPTATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Leonard was not a thief, but the sight of the wallet tempted him, under
      the circumstances. He had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift
      enterprise, and knew of no way of obtaining the requisite sum&mdash;except
      this. It was, indeed, a little shock to him to think of appropriating
      money not his own; yet who would know it? The owner of the wallet was
      drunk, and would be quite unconscious of his loss. Besides, if he didn&rsquo;t
      take the wallet, some one else probably would, and appropriate the entire
      contents. It was an insidious suggestion, and Leonard somehow persuaded
      himself that since the money was sure to be taken, he might as well have
      the benefit of it as anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after turning over the matter in his mind rapidly, he stooped down and
      picked up the wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emboldened by his insensibility, Leonard cautiously opened the pocketbook,
      and his eyes glistened when he saw tucked away in one side, quite a thick
      roll of bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t miss one bill,&rdquo; thought Leonard. &ldquo;Anyone else might take the
      whole wallet, but I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. I wonder how much money there is in
      the roll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted another glance at the prostrate form, but there seemed no danger
      of interruption. He took the roll in his hand, therefore, and a hasty
      scrutiny showed him that the bills ran from ones to tens. There must have
      been nearly a hundred dollars in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I take a five,&rdquo; thought Leonard, whose cupidity increased with
      the sight of the money. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t miss it, and it will be better in my
      hands than if spent for whiskey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How specious are the arguments of those who seek an excuse for a wrong act
      that will put money in the purse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I may venture to take a five, and, as I might not be able to
      change it right away, I will take a one to send for a ticket. Then I will
      put the wallet back in the man&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far, all went smoothly, and Leonard was proceeding to carry out his
      intention when, taking a precautionary look at the man on the ground, he
      was dumfounded by seeing his eyes wide open and fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard flushed painfully, like a criminal detected in a crime, and
      returned the look of inquiry by one of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;you&mdash;doing?&rdquo; inquired the victim of inebriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;is this your wallet, sir?&rdquo; stammered Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it is. What you got it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I saw it on the ground, and was afraid some one would find it,
      and rob you,&rdquo; said Leonard, fluently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody did find it,&rdquo; rejoined the man, whose senses seemed coming back
      to him. &ldquo;How much did you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? You don&rsquo;t think I would take any of your money?&rdquo; said Leonard, in
      virtuous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looked like it! Can&rsquo;t tell who to trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, I had only just picked it up, and was going to put it back
      in your pocket, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, drunk as he was, winked knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart boy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You do it well, ol&rsquo; fella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, it is quite true, I assure you. I will count over the money
      before you. Do you know how much you had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nev&rsquo; mind. Help me up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard stooped over and helped the drunkard to a sitting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I? Where is hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to hotel, and I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said Leonard, briskly. He was to get his dollar after
      all, and would not have to steal it. I am afraid he is not to be praised
      for his honesty, as it seemed to be a matter of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d give me five dollars,&rdquo; thought Leonard, but didn&rsquo;t see his
      way clear to make the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the man on his feet, and guided his steps to the road. As he
      walked along, the inebriate, whose gait was at first unsteady, recovered
      his equilibrium and required less help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long had you been lying there?&rdquo; asked Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I was taken sick,&rdquo; and the inebriate nodded knowingly at
      Leonard, who felt at liberty to laugh, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever get sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; answered Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart boy! Better off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the hotel, and Leonard engaged a room for his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he got money?&rdquo; asked the landlord, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Leonard, &ldquo;he has nearly a hundred dollars. I counted it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Here, James, show the
      gentleman up to No. 15.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, too,&rdquo; said the stranger to Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter followed the more readily because he had not yet been paid his
      dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of No. 15 was opened, and the two entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay with the gentleman a short time,&rdquo; said Leonard to the boy.
      &ldquo;If we want anything we will ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; asked the inebriate, as he sank into a large armchair
      near the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard the name before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want to know for?&rdquo; asked the other, cunningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landlord will want to put it on his book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name? Phil Stark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Stark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that Mr. Stark was not yet quite himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did&mdash;&lsquo;scuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. By the way, you told me you would pay me a dollar for
      bringing you to the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did. Take it,&rdquo; and Philip Stark passed the wallet to Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard felt tempted to take a two-dollar bill instead of a one, as Mr.
      Stark would hardly notice the mistake. Still, he might ask to look at the
      bill, and that would be awkward. So the boy contented himself with the sum
      promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said, as he slipped the bill into his vest pocket.
      &ldquo;Do you want some supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better lie down on the bed. Will you undress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; too much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stark rose from the armchair, and, lurching round to the bed, flung
      himself on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t want me any longer,&rdquo; said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Come round to-morrer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard opened the door and left the room. He resolved to keep the
      appointment, and come round the next day. Who knew but some more of Mr.
      Stark&rsquo;s money might come into his hands? Grown man as he was, he seemed to
      need a guardian, and Leonard was willing to act as such&mdash;for a
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a queer adventure!&rdquo; thought Leonard, as he slowly bent his
      steps towards his uncle&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a dollar out of it, anyway,
      and if he hadn&rsquo;t happened to wake up just as he did I might have done
      better. However, it may turn out as well in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather late, Leonard,&rdquo; said his uncle, in a tone that betrayed
      some irritation. &ldquo;I wanted to send you on an errand, and you are always
      out of the way at such a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; said Leonard, with unusual amiability. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a little
      adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An adventure! What is it?&rdquo; Mr. Gibbon asked, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard proceeded to give an account of his finding the inebriate in the
      meadow, and his guiding him to the hotel. It may readily be supposed that
      he said nothing of his attempt to appropriate a part of the contents of
      the wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo; asked Gibbon, with languid curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil Stark, he calls himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange change came over the face of the bookkeeper. There was a
      frightened look in his eyes, and his color faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil Stark!&rdquo; he repeated, in a startled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings him here?&rdquo; Gibbon asked himself nervously, but no words
      passed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name?&rdquo; asked Leonard, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;have heard it before, but&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t think it is the same
      man.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ARTFUL SCHEME.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this Mr. Stark intend to remain long in the village!&rdquo; inquired the
      bookkeeper, in a tone of assumed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say anything on that point,&rdquo; answered Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not say what business brought him here, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was hardly in condition to say much; he was pretty full,&rdquo; said
      Leonard, with a laugh. &ldquo;However, he wants me to call upon him to-morrow,
      and may tell me then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to call upon him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no reason,&rdquo; said Gibbon, hesitating. Then, after a pause he added:
      &ldquo;If you see the way clear, find out what brings him to Milford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Julius seems a good deal interested in this man, considering that
      he is a stranger,&rdquo; thought the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper was biting his nails, a habit he had when he was annoyed.
      &ldquo;And, Leonard,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mention my name while you are
      speaking to Stark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t want me to,&rdquo; answered Leonard, his face
      betraying unmistakable curiosity. His uncle noted this, and explained
      hurriedly: &ldquo;It is possible that he may be a man whom I once met under
      disagreeable circumstances, and I would prefer not to meet him again.
      Should he learn that I was living here, he would be sure to want to renew
      the acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I see. I don&rsquo;t think he would want to borrow money, for he
      seems to be pretty well provided. I made a dollar out of him to-day, and
      that is one reason why I am willing to call on him again. I may strike him
      for another bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no objection to that, provided you don&rsquo;t talk to him too freely.
      I don&rsquo;t think he will want to stay long in Milford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I had as much money as he probably has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often meet the new boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I see him on the street quite often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives with Mr. Jennings, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather strange. I didn&rsquo;t suppose that Jennings would care to
      receive a boy in his house, or that tall grenadier of a housekeeper,
      either. I expect she rules the household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could tuck him under her arm and walk off with him,&rdquo; said Leonard,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy must be artful to have wormed his way into the favor of the
      strange pair. He seems to be a favorite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle, I think he is. However, I like my position better than his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will learn his business from the beginning. I don&rsquo;t know but it was a
      mistake for you to leave the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sorry for it, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your position doesn&rsquo;t amount to much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am paid just as well as I was when I was in the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are learning nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to teach me bookkeeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that is not altogether a desirable business. A good bookkeeper can
      never expect to be in business for himself. He must be content with a
      salary all his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done pretty well, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no chance of my becoming a rich man. I have to work hard for
      my money. And I haven&rsquo;t been able to lay up much money yet. That reminds
      me? Leonard, I must impress upon you the fact that you have your own way
      to make. I have procured you a place, and I provide you a home&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my wages,&rdquo; said Leonard, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A part of them, but on the whole, you are not self-supporting. You must
      look ahead, Leonard, and consider the future. When you are a young man you
      will want to earn an adequate income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I shall, uncle, but there is one other course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may marry an heiress,&rdquo; suggested Leonard, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was marrying an heiress when I married your aunt,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;but within six months of our wedding day, her father made a bad failure,
      and actually had the assurance to ask me to give him a home under my
      roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I told him it would not be convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got a small clerkship at ten dollars a week in the counting room of a
      mercantile friend, and filled it till one day last October, when he
      dropped dead of apoplexy. I made a great mistake when I married in not
      asking him to settle a definite sum on his daughter. It would have been so
      much saved from the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did aunt want him to come and live here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, women are always unreasonable. She would have had me support the old
      man in idleness, but I am not one of that kind. Every tub should stand on
      its own bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so, too, uncle. Do you know whether this boy, Carl Crawford, has
      any father or mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a word Jennings let fall I infer that he has relatives, but is not
      on good terms with them. I have been a little afraid he might stand in
      your light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should there be any good opening for one of your age, I am afraid he
      would get it rather than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; said Leonard, jealously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living as he does with Mr. Jennings, he will naturally try to ingratiate
      himself with him, and stand first in his esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Is Mr. Jennings a rich man, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he is. The factory and stock are worth considerable money,
      but I know he has other investments also. As one item he has over a
      thousand dollars in the Carterville Savings Bank. He has been very
      prudent, has met with no losses, and has put aside a great share of his
      profits every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he don&rsquo;t marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in his thoughts. Hannah makes him so
      comfortable that he will probably remain a bachelor to the end of his
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will leave his money to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is likely to live as long as she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good deal longer than he,&rdquo; said Leonard, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper condescended to smile at this joke, though it was not very
      brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before this boy Carl came,&rdquo; he resumed thoughtfully, &ldquo;I hoped he might
      take a fancy to you. He must die some time, and, having no near blood
      relative, I thought he might select as heir some boy like yourself, who
      might grow into his favor and get on his blind side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it too late now?&rdquo; asked Leonard, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, but the appearance of this new boy on the scene makes your
      chance a good deal smaller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could get rid of him,&rdquo; said Leonard, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only way is to injure him in the estimation of Mr. Jennings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know of a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an advertisement of a lottery,&rdquo; said Leonard, whose plans, in
      view of what his uncle had said, had experienced a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to the manager in Carl&rsquo;s name, inquiring about tickets, and,
      of course, he will answer to him, to the care of Mr. Jennings. This will
      lead to the suspicion that Carl is interested in such matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good idea. It will open the way to a loss of confidence on the
      part of Mr. Jennings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sit down at your desk and write at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Mr. Jennings handed a letter to Carl after they reached
      home in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter for you to my care,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl opened it in surprise, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office Of Gift Enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carl Crawford:&mdash;Your letter of inquiry is received. In reply we
      would say that we will send you six tickets for five dollars. By disposing
      of them among your friends at one dollar each, you will save the cost of
      your own. You had better remit at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours respectfully, Pitkins &amp; Gamp,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl looked the picture of astonishment when he read this letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      REVEALS A MYSTERY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please read this letter, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      His employer took the letter from his hand, and ran his eye over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to ask my advice about the investment?&rdquo; he said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I wanted to know how such a letter came to be written to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send a letter of inquiry there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, and I can&rsquo;t understand how these men could have got hold of my
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has probably written in your name,&rdquo; he said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who could have done so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will leave the letter in my hands, I may be able to obtain some
      information on that point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad if you can, Mr. Jennings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention to anyone having received such a letter, and if anyone
      broaches the subject, let me know who it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings quietly put on his hat, and walked over to the post office.
      The postmaster, who also kept a general variety store, chanced to be
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly. &ldquo;What can I do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a little information, Mr. Sweetland, though it is doubtful if you
      can give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sweetland assumed the attitude of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know if any letter has been posted from this office within a few
      days, addressed to Pitkins &amp; Gamp, Syracuse, New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; two letters have been handed in bearing this address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings was surprised, for he had never thought of two letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me who handed them in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both were handed in by the same party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy in your employ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked grave. Was it possible that Carl was deceiving him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy who lives at my house?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the boy who usually calls for the factory mail. The nephew of your
      bookkeeper I think his name is Leonard Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings, looking very much relieved. &ldquo;And you say
      he deposited both letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to remember if any other letter like this was received at
      the office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he displayed the envelope of Carl&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; one was received, addressed to the name of the one who deposited the
      first letters&mdash;Leonard Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Sweetland. Your information has cleared up a mystery. Be
      kind enough not to mention the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bear your request in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings bought a supply of stamps, and then left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Carl,&rdquo; he said, when he re-entered the house, &ldquo;I have discovered
      who wrote in your name to Pitkins &amp; Gamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, sir?&rdquo; asked Carl, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could induce him to do it?&rdquo; said Carl, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought that I would see the letter, and would be prejudiced against
      you if I discovered that you were investing in what is a species of
      lottery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought you unwise, and I should have been reminded of a
      fellow workman who became so infatuated with lotteries that he stole money
      from his employer to enable him to continue his purchases of tickets. But
      for this unhappy passion he would have remained honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard must dislike me,&rdquo; said Carl, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is jealous of you; I warned you he or some one else might become so.
      But the most curious circumstance is, he wrote a second letter in his own
      name. I suspect he has bought a ticket. I advise you to say nothing about
      the matter unless questioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Carl met Leonard in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;you got a letter yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought it to the factory with the rest of the mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be close-mouthed,&rdquo; Leonard said to himself. &ldquo;He has sent for
      a ticket, I&rsquo;ll bet a hat, and don&rsquo;t want me to find out. I wish I could
      draw the capital prize&mdash;I would not mind old Jennings finding out
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever hear from your&mdash;friends?&rdquo; he asked a minute later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that letter might be from your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it was a letter from Syracuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now, it was postmarked Syracuse. Have you friends there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I am aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you receive letters from there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a business letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was quietly amused at Leonard&rsquo;s skillful questions, but was
      determined not to give him any light on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard tried another avenue of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I wish I was rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind being rich myself,&rdquo; said Carl, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose old Jennings must have a lot of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jennings, I presume, is very well off,&rdquo; responded Carl, emphasizing
      the title &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had his money I wouldn&rsquo;t live in such Quaker style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have him give fashionable parties?&rdquo; asked Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that he would enjoy that; but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
      would do. I would buy a fast horse&mdash;a two-forty mare&mdash;and a
      bangup buggy, and I&rsquo;d show the old farmers round here what fast driving
      is. Then I&rsquo;d have a stylish house, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d be content to live in Milford, Leonard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would, either, unless my business were here. I&rsquo;d go to
      New York every few weeks and see life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be rich some time, so that you can carry out your wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any easy way of getting money?&rdquo; asked Leonard, pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The easy ways are not generally the true ways. A man sometimes makes
      money by speculation, but he has to have some to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get anything out of him,&rdquo; thought Leonard. &ldquo;Well, good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the street, and joined the man who has already been referred to
      as boarding at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stark had now been several days in Milford. What brought him there, or
      what object he had in staying, Leonard had not yet ascertained. He
      generally spent part of his evenings with the stranger, and had once or
      twice received from him a small sum of money. Usually, however, he had met
      Mr. Stark in the billiard room, and played a game or two of billiards with
      him. Mr. Stark always paid for the use of the table, and that was
      naturally satisfactory to Leonard, who enjoyed amusement at the expense of
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, bearing in mind his uncle&rsquo;s request, had not mentioned his name
      to Mr. Stark, and Stark, though he had walked about the village more or
      less, had not chanced to meet Mr. Gibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had questioned Leonard, however, about Mr. Jennings, and whether he was
      supposed to be rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had answered freely that everyone considered him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t know how to enjoy his money,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should,&rdquo; said Stark, jocularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet we would,&rdquo; returned Leonard; and he was quite sincere in his
      boast, as we know from his conversation with Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Stark, on this particular evening, &ldquo;I never asked you
      about your family, Leonard. I suppose you live with your parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. They are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then whom do you live with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my uncle,&rdquo; answered Leonard, guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his name Craig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to tell him,&rdquo; thought Leonard. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose there will
      be much harm in it. My uncle is bookkeeper for Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and his name is Julius Gibbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip Stark wheeled round, and eyed Leonard in blank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle is Julius Gibbon!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;know my uncle?&rdquo; asked Leonard, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think I do. Take me round to the house. I want to see him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN UNWELCOME GUEST.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Julius Gibbon saw the door open and Philip Stark enter the room where
      he was smoking his noon cigar, his heart quickened its pulsations and he
      turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, old friend?&rdquo; said Stark, boisterously. &ldquo;Funny, isn&rsquo;t it,
      that I should run across your nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very strange!&rdquo; ejaculated Gibbon, looking the reverse of joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a happy meeting, isn&rsquo;t it? We used to see a good deal of each
      other,&rdquo; and he laughed in a way that Gibbon was far from enjoying. &ldquo;Now,
      I&rsquo;ve come over to have a good, long chat with you. Leonard, I think we
      won&rsquo;t keep you, as you wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in our talk about old
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Leonard, you may leave us,&rdquo; added his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard&rsquo;s curiosity was excited, and he would have been glad to remain,
      but as there was no help for it, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone, Stark drew up his chair close, and laid his hand
      familiarly on the bookkeeper&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Gibbon, do you remember where we last met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon shuddered slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at Joliet&mdash;Joliet Penitentiary. Your time expired before
      mine. I envied you the six months&rsquo; advantage you had of me. When I came
      out I searched for you everywhere, but heard nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know I was here?&rdquo; asked the bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I had no suspicion of it. Nor did I dream that Leonard,
      who was able to do me a little service, was your nephew. I say, he&rsquo;s a
      chip of the old block, Gibbon,&rdquo; and Stark laughed as if he enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lying in a field, overcome by liquor, an old weakness of mine, you
      know, and my wallet had slipped out of my pocket. I chanced to open my
      eyes, when I saw it in the hands of your promising nephew, ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t tell you that he was on the point of appropriating a part
      of the contents? I warrant you he didn&rsquo;t tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he acknowledge it? Perhaps you misjudged him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t acknowledge it in so many words, but I knew it by his change of
      color and confusion. Oh, I didn&rsquo;t lay it up against him. We are very good
      friends. He comes honestly by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon looked very much annoyed, but there were reasons why he did not
      care to express his chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor, it was an immense surprise to me,&rdquo; proceeded Stark, &ldquo;when I
      learned that my old friend Gibbon was a resident of Milford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had never found it out,&rdquo; thought Gibbon, biting his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sooner did I hear it than I posted off at once to call on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stark elevated his eyebrows, and looked amused. He saw that he was not a
      welcome visitor, but for that he cared little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got on, though? Here I find you the trusted bookkeeper of an
      important business firm. Did you bring recommendations from your last
      place?&rdquo; and he burst into a loud guffaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t make such references,&rdquo; snapped Gibbon. &ldquo;They can do
      no good, and might do harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, my dear boy. I rejoice at your good fortune. Wish I was
      equally well fixed. You don&rsquo;t ask how I am getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are prosperous,&rdquo; said Gibbon, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be more so. Is there a place vacant in your office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there were, you might not recommend me, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need to speak of that. There is no vacancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I wish there were, as I am getting to the end of my tether.
      I may have money enough to last me four weeks longer, but no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can help you,&rdquo; said Gibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much salary does Mr. Jennings pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred dollars a month,&rdquo; answered the bookkeeper, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad, in a cheap place like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes all I make to pay expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember&mdash;you have a wife. I have no such incumbrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one question I would like to ask you,&rdquo; said the bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire away, dear boy. Have you an extra cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Now I shall be comfortable. Go ahead with your question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you to Milford? You didn&rsquo;t know of my being here, you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I. I came on my old business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard there was a rich manufacturer here&mdash;I allude to your
      respected employer. I thought I might manage to open his safe some dark
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Gibbon in alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Stark, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Gibbon, in some agitation, &ldquo;I might be suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you might; but I have got to look out for number one. How
      do you expect me to live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go somewhere else. There are plenty of other men as rich, and richer,
      where you would not be compromising an old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I have an old friend in the office that I have thought this
      would be my best opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, man, you don&rsquo;t expect me to betray my employer, and join with you
      in robbing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do expect. Don&rsquo;t tell me you have grown virtuous,
      Gibbon. The tiger doesn&rsquo;t lose his spots or the leopard his stripes. I
      tell you there&rsquo;s a fine chance for us both. I&rsquo;ll divide with you, if
      you&rsquo;ll help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve gone out of the business,&rdquo; protested Gibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. Come, old boy, I can&rsquo;t let any sentimental scruples interfere
      with so good a stroke of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t help you!&rdquo; said Gibbon, angrily. &ldquo;You only want to get me into
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t help me?&rdquo; said Stark, with slow deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t honorably. Can&rsquo;t you let me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to say, I can&rsquo;t. If I was rich, I might; but as it is, it is quite
      necessary for me to raise some money somewhere. By all accounts, Jennings
      is rich, and can spare a small part of his accumulations for a good fellow
      that&rsquo;s out of luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better give up the idea. It&rsquo;s quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; asked Stark, with a wicked look. &ldquo;Then do you know what I will
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Gibbon, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call on your employer, and tell him what I know of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do that?&rdquo; said the bookkeeper, much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You turn your back upon an old friend. You bask in prosperity,
      and turn from him in his poverty. It&rsquo;s the way of the world, no doubt; but
      Phil Stark generally gets even with those who don&rsquo;t treat him well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you want me to do,&rdquo; said Gibbon, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first whether your safe contains much of value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We keep a line of deposit with the Milford Bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that nothing of value is left in the safe overnight?&rdquo;
       asked Stark, disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a box of government bonds usually kept there,&rdquo; the bookkeeper
      admitted, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; returned Stark, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Do you know how
      much they amount to?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. STARK IS RECOGNIZED.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phil Stark was resolved not to release his hold upon his old acquaintance.
      During the day he spent his time in lounging about the town, but in the
      evening he invariably fetched up at the bookkeeper&rsquo;s modest home. His
      attentions were evidently not welcome to Mr. Gibbon, who daily grew more
      and more nervous and irritable, and had the appearance of a man whom
      something disquieted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard watched the growing intimacy with curiosity. He was a sharp boy,
      and he felt convinced that there was something between his uncle and the
      stranger. There was no chance for him to overhear any conversation, for he
      was always sent out of the way when the two were closeted together. He
      still met Mr. Stark outside, and played billiards with him frequently.
      Once he tried to extract some information from Stark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known my uncle a good while,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of assumed
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a good many years,&rdquo; answered Stark, as he made a carom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in business together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, but we may be some time,&rdquo; returned Stark, with a significant
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that isn&rsquo;t decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you first meet Uncle Julius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s growing curious,&rdquo; said Stark to himself. &ldquo;Does he think he can
      pull wool over the eyes of Phil Stark? If he does, he thinks a good deal
      too highly of himself. I will answer his questions to suit myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your uncle that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;but he snapped me up, and told me to mind my own
      business. He is getting terribly cross lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his stomach, I presume,&rdquo; said Stark, urbanely. &ldquo;He is a confirmed
      dyspeptic&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with him. Now; I&rsquo;ve got the
      digestion of an ox. Nothing ever troubles me, and the result is that I am
      as calm and good-natured as a May morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get riled, Mr. Stark?&rdquo; asked Leonard, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly ever. Sometimes when I am asked fool questions by one who
      seems to be prying into what is none of his business, I get wrathy, and
      when I&rsquo;m roused look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced meaningly at Leonard, and the boy understood that the words
      conveyed a warning and a menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter with you, Mr. Gibbon? Are you as well as usual?&rdquo;
       asked Mr. Jennings one morning. The little man was always considerate, and
      he had noticed the flurried and nervous manner of his bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; what makes you ask?&rdquo; said Gibbon, apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you need a vacation,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I think not. Besides, I couldn&rsquo;t be spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would keep the books myself for a week to favor you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, but I won&rsquo;t trouble you just yet. A little later on,
      if I feel more uncomfortable, I will avail myself of your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so. I know that bookkeeping is a strain upon the mind, more so than
      physical labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were special reasons why Mr. Gibbon did not dare to accept the
      vacation tendered him by his employer. He knew that Phil Stark would be
      furious, for it would interfere with his designs. He could not afford to
      offend this man, who held in his possession a secret affecting his
      reputation and good name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of a stranger in a small town always attracts public
      attention, and many were curious about the rakish-looking man who had now
      for some time occupied a room at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among others, Carl had several times seen him walking with Leonard Craig
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard,&rdquo; he asked one day, &ldquo;who is the gentleman I see you so often
      walking with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man that&rsquo;s boarding at the hotel. I play billiards with him
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to like Milford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s over at our house every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; asked Carl, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s an old acquaintance of Uncle Julius. I don&rsquo;t know where they
      met each other, for he won&rsquo;t tell. He said he and uncle might go into
      business together some time. Between you and me, I think uncle would like
      to get rid of him. I know he doesn&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This set Carl to thinking, but something occurred soon afterwards that
      impressed him still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally a customer of the house visited Milford, wishing to give a
      special order for some particular line of goods. About this time a Mr.
      Thorndike, from Chicago, came to Milford on this errand, and put up at the
      hotel. He had called at the factory during the day, and had some
      conversation with Mr. Jennings. After supper a doubt entered the mind of
      the manufacturer in regard to one point, and he said to Carl: &ldquo;Carl, are
      you engaged this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you carry a note for me to the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir; I shall be glad to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thorndike leaves in the morning, and I am not quite clear as to one
      of the specifications he gave me with his order. You noticed the gentleman
      who went through the factory with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Mr. Thorndike. Please hand him this note, and if he wishes you to
      remain with him for company, you had better do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannah,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings, as his messenger left with the note, &ldquo;Carl is
      a pleasant addition to our little household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed he is,&rdquo; responded Hannah, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he was twice the trouble I&rsquo;d be glad to have him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is easy to get along with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet his stepmother drove him from his father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a wicked trollop, then!&rdquo; said Hannah, in a deep, stern voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      like to get hold of her, I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do to her?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give her a good shaking,&rdquo; answered Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you would, Hannah,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings, amused. &ldquo;On the whole, I
      think she had better keep out of your clutches. Still, but for her we
      would never have met with Carl. What is his father&rsquo;s loss is our gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a poor, weak man his father must be,&rdquo; said Hannah, contemptuously,
      &ldquo;to let a woman like her turn him against his own flesh and blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, Hannah. I hope some time he may see his mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl kept on his way to the hotel. It was summer and Mr. Thorndike was
      sitting on the piazza smoking a cigar. To him Carl delivered the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he said, rapidly glancing it over. &ldquo;You may tell Mr.
      Jennings,&rdquo; and here he gave an answer to the question asked in the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I will remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down and keep me company a little while?&rdquo; asked Thorndike,
      who was sociably inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; and Carl sat down in a chair beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, sir. I don&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where you are sensible. I began to smoke at fourteen, and now I
      find it hard to break off. My doctor tells me it is hurting me, but the
      chains of habit are strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason for forming good habits, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like a philosopher. Are you in the employ of my friend, Mr.
      Jennings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learning the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my present intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever come out to Chicago, call on me, and if you are out of a
      place, I will give you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not a little rash, Mr. Thorndike, to offer me a place when you
      know so little of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust a good deal to looks. I care more for them than for
      recommendations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Phil Stark came out of the hotel, and passing them, stepped
      off the piazza into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorndike half rose from his seat, and looked after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; he asked, in an exciting whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man named Stark, who is boarding at the hotel. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know him?&rdquo; repeated Thorndike. &ldquo;He is one of the most successful
      burglars in the West.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PREPARING FOR THE BURGLAR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl stared at Mr. Thorndike in surprise and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A burglar!&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was present in the courtroom when he was convicted of robbing the
      Springfield bank. I sat there for three hours, and his face was impressed
      upon my memory. I saw him later on in the Joliet Penitentiary. I was
      visiting the institution and saw the prisoners file out into the yard. I
      recognized this man instantly. Do you know how long he has been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two weeks I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has some dishonest scheme in his head, I have no doubt. Have you a
      bank in Milford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have some design upon that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very intimate with our bookkeeper, so his nephew tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorndike looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I scent danger to my friend, Mr. Jennings. He ought to be apprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall be, sir,&rdquo; said Carl, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you see him to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I am not only in his employ, but I live at his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to go home at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No attempt will be made to rob the office till late. It is scarcely eight
      o&rsquo;clock. I don&rsquo;t know, however, but I will walk around to the house with
      you, and tell your employer what I know. By the way, what sort of a man is
      the bookkeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him very well, sir. He has a nephew in the office, who was
      transferred from the factory. I have taken his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the bookkeeper would join in a plot to rob his employer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him. To me he is always disagreeable, but I would not like
      to say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has he been in the employ of Mr. Jennings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as two years, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that this man is intimate with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Craig&mdash;he is the nephew&mdash;says that Mr. Philip Stark is
      at his uncle&rsquo;s house every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he calls himself Philip Stark, does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is one of his names. He was convicted under that name, and
      retains it here on account of its being so far from the place of his
      conviction. Whether it is his real name or not, I do not know. What is the
      name of your bookkeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julius Gibbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember ever having heard it. Evidently there has been some past
      acquaintance between the two men, and that, I should say, is hardly a
      recommendation for Mr. Gibbon. Of course that alone is not enough to
      condemn him, but the intimacy is certainly a suspicious circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two soon reached the house of Mr. Jennings, for the distance was only
      a quarter of a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings seemed a little surprised, but gave a kindly welcome to his
      unexpected guest. It occurred to him that he might have come to give some
      extra order for goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised to see me,&rdquo; said Thorndike. &ldquo;I came on a very important
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of inquiry came over the face of Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thief in the village&mdash;a guest at the hotel&mdash;whom I
      recognize as one of the most expert burglars in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know whom you mean, a man of moderate height, rather thick set,
      with small, black eyes and a slouch hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you tell me about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorndike repeated the statement he had already made to Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think our bank is in danger?&rdquo; asked the manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so, but the chief danger threatens you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this man appears to be very intimate with your bookkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked the little man, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer you to Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Craig told me to-night that this man Stark spent every evening at
      his uncle&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dislike to lose confidence in any
      man whom I have trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed anything unusual in the demeanor of your bookkeeper of
      late?&rdquo; asked Thorndike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he has appeared out of spirits and nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would seem to indicate he is conspiring to rob you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very day, noticing the change in him, I offered him a week&rsquo;s
      vacation. He promptly declined to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. It would conflict with the plans of his confederate. I don&rsquo;t
      know the man, but I do know human nature, and I venture to predict that
      your safe will be opened within a week. Do you keep anything of value in
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are my books, which are of great value to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to a thief. Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have a tin box containing four thousand dollars in government
      bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coupon or registered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coupon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be better&mdash;for a burglar. What on earth could induce
      you to keep the bonds in your own safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, I considered them quite as safe there as in the bank.
      Banks are more likely to be robbed than private individuals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances alter cases. Does anyone know that you have the bonds in
      your safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bookkeeper is aware of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my friend, I caution you to remove the bonds from so unsafe a
      depository as soon as possible. Unless I am greatly mistaken, this man,
      Stark, has bought over your bookkeeper, and will have his aid in robbing
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To remove the bonds this very evening,&rdquo; said Thorndike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the danger so pressing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know that an attempt will be made to-night, but it is
      quite possible. Should it be so, you would have an opportunity to realize
      that delays are dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should Mr. Gibbon find, on opening the safe to-morrow morning, that the
      box is gone, it may lead to an attack upon my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to leave the box in the safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I understand that you advised me to remove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the box, but the bonds. Listen to my plan. Cut out some newspaper
      slips of about the same bulk as the bonds, put them in place of the bonds
      in the box, and quietly transfer the bonds in your pocket to your own
      house. To-morrow you can place them in the bank. Should no burglary be
      attempted, let the box remain in the safe, just as if its contents were
      valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your advice is good, and I will adopt it,&rdquo; said Jennings, &ldquo;and thank you
      for your valuable and friendly instruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If agreeable to you I will accompany you to the office at once. The bonds
      cannot be removed too soon. Then if anyone sees us entering, it will be
      thought that you are showing me the factory. It will divert suspicion,
      even if we are seen by Stark or your bookkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go, too?&rdquo; asked Carl, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the manufacturer. &ldquo;I know, Carl, that you are devoted to
      my interests. It is a comfort to know this, now that I have cause to
      suspect my bookkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only a little after nine. The night was moderately dark, and Carl
      was intrusted with a wax candle, which he put in his pocket for use in the
      office. They reached the factory without attracting attention, and entered
      by the office door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings opened the safe&mdash;he and the bookkeeper alone knew the
      combination&mdash;and with some anxiety took out the tin box. It was
      possible that the contents had already been removed. But no! on opening
      it, the bonds were found intact. According to Mr. Thorndike&rsquo;s advice, he
      transferred them to his pocket, and substituted folded paper. Then,
      replacing everything, the safe was once more locked, and the three left
      the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorndike returned to the hotel, and Mr. Jennings to his house, but
      Carl asked permission to remain out a while longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is on my mind that an attempt will be made to-night to rob the safe,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I want to watch near the factory to see if my suspicion is
      correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Carl, but don&rsquo;t stay out too long!&rdquo; said his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I see them entering the office, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt them! They will find themselves badly fooled. Notice only
      if Mr. Gibbon is of the party. I must know whether my bookkeeper is to be
      trusted.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BURGLARY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl seated himself behind a stone wall on the opposite side of the street
      from the factory. The building was on the outskirts of the village, though
      not more than half a mile from the post office, and there was very little
      travel in that direction during the evening. This made it more favorable
      for thieves, though up to the present time no burglarious attempt had been
      made on it. Indeed, Milford had been exceptionally fortunate in that
      respect. Neighboring towns had been visited, some of them several times,
      but Milford had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was quite dark, but not what is called pitchy dark. As the eyes
      became accustomed to the obscurity, they were able to see a considerable
      distance. So it was with Carl. From his place of concealment he
      occasionally raised his head and looked across the way to the factory. An
      hour passed, and he grew tired. It didn&rsquo;t look as if the attempt were to
      be made that night. Eleven o&rsquo;clock pealed out from the spire of the
      Baptist Church, a quarter of a mile away. Carl counted the strokes, and
      when the last died into silence, he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay here about ten minutes longer. Then, if no one comes, I will
      give it up for tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time was nearly up when his quick ear caught a low murmur of voices.
      Instantly he was on the alert. Waiting till the sound came nearer, he
      ventured to raise his head for an instant above the top of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat with excitement when he saw two figures approaching. Though
      it was so dark, he recognized them by their size and outlines. They were
      Julius Gibbon, the bookkeeper, and Phil Stark, the stranger staying at the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl watched closely, raising his head for a few seconds at a time above
      the wall, ready to lower it should either glance in his direction. But
      neither of the men did so. Ignorant that they were suspected, it was the
      farthest possible from their thoughts that anyone would be on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came so near that Carl could hear their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it was over,&rdquo; murmured Gibbon, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said his companion. &ldquo;There is no occasion for haste.
      Everybody in Milford is in bed and asleep, and we have several hours at
      our disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember that my reputation is at stake. This night&rsquo;s work may
      undo me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, you can afford to take the chances. Haven&rsquo;t I agreed to give
      you half the bonds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be suspected, and shall be obliged to stand my ground, while you
      will disappear from the scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand dollars will pay you for some inconvenience. I don&rsquo;t see why
      you should be suspected. You will be supposed to be fast asleep on your
      virtuous couch, while some bad burglar is robbing your worthy employer. Of
      course you will be thunderstruck when in the morning the appalling
      discovery is made. I&rsquo;ll tell you what will be a good dodge for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offer a reward of a hundred dollars from your own purse for the discovery
      of the villain who has robbed the safe and abstracted the bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark burst out into a loud guffaw as he uttered these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Gibbon, timidly. &ldquo;I thought I heard some one moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a timid fool you are!&rdquo; muttered Stark, contemptuously. &ldquo;If I had no
      more pluck, I&rsquo;d hire myself out to herd cows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a better business,&rdquo; said Gibbon, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, each to his taste! If you lose your place as bookkeeper, you
      might offer your services to some farmer. As for me, the danger, though
      there isn&rsquo;t much, is just enough to make it exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for any such excitement,&rdquo; said Gibbon, dispiritedly. &ldquo;Why
      couldn&rsquo;t you have kept away and let me earn an honest living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I must live as well as you, my dear friend. When this little
      affair is over, you will thank me for helping you to a good thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course all this conversation did not take place within Carl&rsquo;s hearing.
      While it was going on, the men had opened the office door and entered.
      Then, as Carl watched the window closely he saw a narrow gleam of light
      from a dark lantern illuminating the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now they are at the safe,&rdquo; thought Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, who are privileged, will enter the office and watch the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon had no difficulty in opening the safe, for he was acquainted with
      the combination. Stark thrust in his hand eagerly and drew out the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what we want,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of satisfaction. &ldquo;Have you a
      key that will open it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall have to take box and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get through as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Gibbon, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can close the safe, if you want to. There is nothing else worth
      taking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will evacuate the premises. Is there an old newspaper I can use
      to wrap up the box in? It might look suspicious if anyone should see it in
      our possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here is one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed a copy of a weekly paper to Phil Stark, who skillfully wrapped
      up the box, and placing it under his arm, went out of the office, leaving
      Gibbon to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you carry it?&rdquo; asked Gibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere out of sight where I can safely open it. I should have
      preferred to take the bonds, and leave the box in the safe. Then the bonds
      might not have been missed for a week or more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would have been better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the last that Carl heard. The two disappeared in the darkness,
      and Carl, raising himself from his place of concealment, stretched his
      cramped limbs and made the best of his way home. He thought no one would
      be up, but Mr. Jennings came out from the sitting-room, where he had flung
      himself on a lounge, and met Carl in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The safe has been robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; asked the manufacturer, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two we suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Mr. Gibbon, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he was accompanied by Mr. Stark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw them enter the factory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I was crouching behind the stone wall on the other side of the
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were they inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not over fifteen minutes&mdash;perhaps only ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gibbon knew the combination,&rdquo; said Jennings, quietly. &ldquo;There was no
      occasion to lose time in breaking open the safe. There is some advantage
      in having a friend inside. Did you see them go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrying the tin box with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Stark wrapped it in a newspaper after they got outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you saw the tin box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if necessary, you can testify to it. I thought it possible that Mr.
      Gibbon might have a key to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overheard Stark regretting that he could not open it so as to abstract
      the bonds and leave the box in the safe. In that case, he said, it might
      be some time before the robbery was discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will himself make an unpleasant discovery when he opens the box. I
      don&rsquo;t think there is any call to pity him, do you, Carl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I should like to be within sight when he opens it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manufacturer laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if I could see it I should feel repaid for the loss of
      the box. Let it be a lesson for you, my boy. Those who seek to enrich
      themselves by unlawful means are likely in the end to meet with
      disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I need the lesson?&rdquo; asked Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lad. I am sure you don&rsquo;t. But you do need a good night&rsquo;s rest. Let
      us go to bed at once, and get what sleep we may. I won&rsquo;t allow the
      burglary to keep me awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in high good humor, and Carl went up to his comfortable room,
      where he soon lost all remembrance of the exciting scene of which he had
      been a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings went to the factory at the usual time the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the office the bookkeeper approached him pale and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly, &ldquo;I have bad news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Gibbon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I opened the safe this morning, I discovered that the tin box had
      been stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings took the news quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any suspicion who took it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I&mdash;I hope the loss is not a heavy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care to make the extent of the loss public. Were there any marks
      of violence? Was the safe broken open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular; is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me I will join in offering a reward for the discovery
      of the thief. I feel in a measure responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think of your offer, Mr. Gibbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suspects nothing,&rdquo; thought Gibbon, with a sigh of relief.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      STARK&rsquo;S DISAPPOINTMENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Philip Stark went back to the hotel with the tin box under his arm. He
      would like to have entered the hotel without notice, but this was
      impossible, for the landlord&rsquo;s nephew was just closing up. Though not late
      for the city, it was very late for the country, and he looked surprised
      when Stark came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am out late,&rdquo; said Stark, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, late for Milford. In the city I never go to bed before
      midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been out walking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it rather dark, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dark as a pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have found the walk a very pleasant one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my friend; but I didn&rsquo;t walk for pleasure. The fact is, I
      am rather worried about a business matter. I have learned that I am
      threatened with a heavy loss&mdash;an unwise investment in the West&mdash;and
      I wanted time to think it over and decide how to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; answered the clerk, respectfully, for Stark&rsquo;s words led him to
      think that his guest was a man of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was rich enough to be worried by such a cause,&rdquo; he said,
      jokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were. Some time I may be able to throw something in your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it would pay me to go to the West?&rdquo; asked the clerk,
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it quite likely&mdash;if you know some one out in that section.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me,&rdquo; said Stark, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could help me to a place, Mr. Stark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could. A month from now write to me Col. Philip Stark, at
      Denver, Colorado, and I will see if I can find an opening for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr.&mdash;I mean Col. Stark,&rdquo; said the clerk,
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind about the title,&rdquo; returned Stark, smiling good-naturedly.
      &ldquo;I only gave it to you just now, because everybody in Denver knows me as a
      colonel, and I am afraid a letter otherwise addressed would not reach me.
      By the way, I am sorry that I shall probably have to leave you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s this tiresome business. I should not wonder if I might lose ten
      thousand dollars through the folly of my agent. I shall probably have to
      go out to right things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose ten thousand dollars,&rdquo; said the young man,
      regarding the capitalist before him with deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I expect not. At your age I wasn&rsquo;t worth ten thousand cents. Now&mdash;but
      that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Give me a light, please, and I will go up
      to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was about to say how much he is worth now,&rdquo; soliloquized the clerk. &ldquo;I
      wish he had not stopped short. If I can&rsquo;t be rich myself, I like to talk
      with a rich man. There&rsquo;s hope for me, surely. He says that at my age he
      was not worth ten thousand cents. That is only a hundred dollars, and I am
      worth that. I must keep it to pay my expenses to Colorado, if he should
      send for me in a few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had noticed with some curiosity the rather oddly-shaped
      bundle which Stark carried under his arm, but could not see his way clear
      to asking any questions about it. It seemed queer that Stark should have
      it with him while walking. Come to think of it, he remembered seeing him
      go out in the early evening, and he was quite confident that at that time
      he had no bundle with him. However, he was influenced only by a spirit of
      idle curiosity. He had no idea that the bundle was of any importance or
      value. The next day he changed his opinion on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark went up to his chamber, and setting the lamp on the bureau,
      first carefully locked the door, and then removed the paper from the tin
      box. He eyed it lovingly, and tried one by one the keys he had in his
      pocket, but none exactly fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was experimenting he thought with a smile of the night clerk from
      whom he had just parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stark,&rdquo; he soliloquized, addressing himself, &ldquo;you are an old humbug. You
      have cleverly duped that unsophisticated young man downstairs. He looks
      upon you as a man of unbounded wealth, evidently, while, as a matter of
      fact, you are almost strapped. Let me see how much I have got left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his wallet, and counted out seven dollars and thirty-eight
      cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can hardly be said to constitute wealth,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;but it is
      all I have over and above the contents of this box. That makes all the
      difference. Gibbon is of opinion that there are four thousand dollars in
      bonds inside, and he expects me to give him half. Shall I do it? Not such
      a fool! I&rsquo;ll give him fifteen hundred and keep the balance myself. That&rsquo;ll
      pay him handsomely, and the rest will be a good nestegg for me. If Gibbon
      is only half shrewd he will pull the wool over the eyes of that midget of
      an employer, and retain his place and comfortable salary. There will be no
      evidence against him, and he can pose as an innocent man. Bah! what a lot
      of humbug there is in the world. Well, well, Stark, you have your share,
      no doubt. Otherwise how would you make a living? To-morrow I must clear
      out from Milford, and give it a wide berth in future. I suppose there will
      be a great hue-and-cry about the robbery of the safe. It will be just as
      well for me to be somewhere else. I have already given the clerk a good
      reason for my sudden departure. Confound it, it&rsquo;s a great nuisance that I
      can&rsquo;t open this box! I would like to know before I go to bed just how much
      boodle I have acquired. Then I can decide how much to give Gibbon. If I
      dared I&rsquo;d keep the whole, but he might make trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark, or Col. Philip Stark, as he had given his name, had a large
      supply of keys, but none of them seemed to fit the tin box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall excite suspicion if I sit up any longer,&rdquo; thought
      Stark. &ldquo;I will go to bed and get up early in the morning. Then I may
      succeed better in opening this plaguy box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed his clothing and got into bed. The evening had been rather an
      exciting one, but the excitement was a pleasurable one, for he had
      succeeded in the plan which he and the bookkeeper had so ingeniously
      formed and carried out, and here within reach was the rich reward after
      which they had striven. Mr. Stark was not troubled with a conscience&mdash;that
      he had got rid of years ago&mdash;and he was filled with a comfortable
      consciousness of having retrieved his fortunes when they were on the wane.
      So, in a short time he fell asleep, and slept peacefully. Toward morning,
      however, he had a disquieting dream. It seemed to him that he awoke
      suddenly from slumber and saw Gibbon leaving the room with the tin box
      under his arm. He awoke really with beads of perspiration upon his brow&mdash;awoke
      to see by the sun streaming in at his window that the morning was well
      advanced, and the tin box was still safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven, it was but a dream!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I must get up and try
      once more to open the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keys had all been tried, and had proved not to fit. Mr. Stark was
      equal to the emergency. He took from his pocket a button hook and bent it
      so as to make a pick, and after a little experimenting succeeded in
      turning the lock. He lifted the lid eagerly, and with distended eyes
      prepared to gloat upon the stolen bonds. But over his face there came a
      startling change. The ashy blue hue of disappointment succeeded the
      glowing, hopeful look. He snatched at one of the folded slips of paper and
      opened it. Alas! it was valueless, mere waste paper. He sank into a chair
      in a limp, hopeless posture, quite overwhelmed. Then he sprang up
      suddenly, and his expression changed to one of fury and menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Julius Gibbon has played this trick upon me,&rdquo; he said, between his set
      teeth, &ldquo;he shall repent it&mdash;bitterly!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Philip Stark sat down to breakfast in a savage frame of mind. He wanted to
      be revenged upon Gibbon, whom he suspected of having deceived him by
      opening and appropriating the bonds, and then arranged to have him carry
      off the box filled with waste paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at the table but five minutes, for he had little or no appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the breakfast room he went out on the piazza, and with corrugated
      brows smoked a cigar, but it failed to have the usual soothing effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had known the truth he would have left Milford without delay, but he
      was far from suspecting that the deception practiced upon him had been
      arranged by the man whom he wanted to rob. While there seemed little
      inducement for him to stay in Milford, he was determined to seek the
      bookkeeper, and ascertain whether, as he suspected, his confederate had in
      his possession the bonds which he had been scheming for. If so, he would
      compel him by threats to disgorge the larger portion, and then leave town
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem was, how to see him. He felt that it would be venturesome
      to go round to the factory, as by this time the loss might have been
      discovered. If only the box had been left, the discovery might be
      deferred. Then a bright idea occurred to him. He must get the box out of
      his own possession, as its discovery would compromise him. Why could he
      not arrange to leave it somewhere on the premises of his confederate?
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved upon the instant to carry out the idea. He went up to his
      room, wrapped the tin box in a paper, and walked round to the house of the
      bookkeeper. The coast seemed to be clear, as he supposed it would be. He
      slipped into the yard, and swiftly entered an outhouse. There was a large
      wooden chest, or box, which had once been used to store grain. Stark
      lifted the cover, dropped the box inside, and then, with a feeling of
      relief, walked out of the yard. But he had been observed. Mrs. Gibbon
      chanced to be looking out of a side window and saw him. She recognized him
      as the stranger who had been in the habit of spending recent evenings with
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he want here at this time?&rdquo; she asked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deliberated whether she should go to the door and speak to Stark, but
      decided not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will call at the door if he has anything to say,&rdquo; she reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark walked on till he reached the factory. He felt that he must see
      Julius Gibbon, and satisfy himself as to the meaning of the mysterious
      substitution of waste paper for bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached a point where he could see into the office, he caught the
      eye of Leonard, who was sitting at the window. He beckoned for him to come
      out, and Leonard was glad to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the bookkeeper, observing the boy&rsquo;s movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stark is just across the street, and he beckoned for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius Gibbon flushed painfully, and he trembled with nervous agitation,
      for he feared something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, go out, but don&rsquo;t stay long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard crossed the street and walked up to Stark, who awaited him,
      looking grim and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle is inside?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I wish to see him at once&mdash;on business of importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t leave the office in business
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I must see him&mdash;do you hear? He&rsquo;ll come fast enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; thought Leonard, whose curiosity was
      naturally excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said Stark, as he turned to go. &ldquo;Is Jennings in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he has gone over to the next town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably the box has not been missed, then,&rdquo; thought Stark. &ldquo;So much the
      better! I can find out how matters stand, and then leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; he said, aloud, &ldquo;let your uncle understand that I must see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard carried in the message. Gibbon made no objection, but took his hat
      and went out, leaving Leonard in charge of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he asked, hurriedly, as he reached Stark. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is
      the box all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Gibbon,&rdquo; said Stark, harshly, &ldquo;have you been playing any of
      your infernal tricks upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; responded Gibbon, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stark eyed him sharply, but the bookkeeper was evidently sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything wrong?&rdquo; continued the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you didn&rsquo;t know that wretched box was filled with
      waste paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo; exclaimed Gibbon, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. I didn&rsquo;t open it till this morning, and in place of government
      bonds, I found only folded slips of newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Gibbon was suspicious. Having no confidence in Stark, it
      occurred to him that it was a ruse to deprive him of his share of the
      bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You want to keep all the bonds for
      yourself, and cheat me out of my share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven you were right. If there had been any bonds, I would
      have acted on the square. But somebody had removed them, and substituted
      paper. I suspected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to swear that this has happened without my knowledge,&rdquo; said
      Gibbon, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then, could it have occurred?&rdquo; asked Stark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, upon my honor. Where is the box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;have disposed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have waited and opened it before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you if you had a key that would open it. I wanted to open it last
      evening in the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see after a while that I was acting on the square. You can open
      it for yourself at your leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? I don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can enlighten you,&rdquo; said Stark, maliciously. &ldquo;When you go home,
      you will find it in a chest in your woodshed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have carried it to my house?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. I had no further use for it, and thought you had the best
      claim to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good heavens! if it is found there I shall be suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; answered Stark, coolly. &ldquo;Take my advice and put it out of
      the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you be so inconsiderate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I suspected you of playing me a trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then somebody has tricked both of us. Has Mr. Jennings discovered the
      disappearance of the box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he came to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took the matter coolly. He didn&rsquo;t say much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to Winchester on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! Do you think he suspects you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure not. That is why I told him about the robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might suspect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said nothing about suspecting anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he removed the bonds and substituted paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were the case we should both be in a serious plight. I think I
      had better get out of town. You will have to lend me ten dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can, Stark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must!&rdquo; said Stark, sternly, &ldquo;or I will reveal the whole thing.
      Remember, the box is on your premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! what a quandary I am in,&rdquo; said the bookkeeper, miserably. &ldquo;That
      must be attended to at once. Why couldn&rsquo;t you put it anywhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that I wanted to be revenged upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had never come to Milford,&rdquo; groaned the bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t myself, as things have turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They prepared to start for Gibbon&rsquo;s house, when Mr. Jennings drove up.
      With him were two tall muscular men, whom Stark and Gibbon eyed uneasily.
      The two strangers jumped out of the carriage and advanced toward the two
      confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest those men!&rdquo; said Jennings, in a quiet tone. &ldquo;I charge them with
      opening and robbing my safe last night about eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BROUGHT TO BAY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phil Stark made an effort to get away, but the officer was too quick for
      him. In a trice he was handcuffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this outrage?&rdquo; demanded Stark, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already explained,&rdquo; said the manufacturer, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite on the wrong tack,&rdquo; continued Stark, brazenly. &ldquo;Mr. Gibbon
      was just informing me that the safe had been opened and robbed. It is the
      first I knew of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius Gibbon seemed quite prostrated by his arrest. He felt it necessary
      to say something, and followed the lead of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bear me witness, Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was the first
      to inform you of the robbery. If I had really committed the burglary, I
      should have taken care to escape during the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to believe in your innocence,&rdquo; rejoined the
      manufacturer, &ldquo;but I know more about this matter than you suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t answer for Mr. Gibbon,&rdquo; said Stark, who cared nothing for his
      confederate, if he could contrive to effect his own escape. &ldquo;Of course he
      had opportunities, as bookkeeper, which an outsider could not have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon eyed his companion in crime distrustfully. He saw that Stark was
      intending to throw him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely willing to have my room at the hotel searched,&rdquo; continued
      Stark, gathering confidence. &ldquo;If you find any traces of the stolen
      property there, you are welcome to make the most of them. I have no doubt
      Mr. Gibbon will make you the same offer in regard to his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gibbon saw at once the trap which had been so craftily prepared for him.
      He knew that any search of his premises would result in the discovery of
      the tin box, and had no doubt that Stark would be ready to testify to any
      falsehood likely to fasten the guilt upon him. His anger was roused and he
      forgot his prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;scoundrel!&rdquo; he hissed between his closed teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem excited,&rdquo; sneered Stark. &ldquo;Is it possible that you object to the
      search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the missing box is found on my premises,&rdquo; said Gibbon, in a white
      heat, &ldquo;it is because you have concealed it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that settles it. I am afraid Mr Gibbon is
      guilty. I shall be glad to assist you to recover the stolen property. Did
      the box contain much that was of value?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must caution you both against saying anything that will compromise
      you,&rdquo; said one of the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to conceal,&rdquo; went on Stark, brazenly. &ldquo;I am obliged to
      believe that this man committed the burglary. It is against me that I have
      been his companion for the last week or two, but I used to know him, and
      that will account for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy bookkeeper saw the coils closing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will see your way to release me,&rdquo; said Stark, addressing
      himself to Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;I have just received information that my poor
      mother is lying dangerously sick in Cleveland, and I am anxious to start
      for her bedside to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come round here this morning?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask Mr. Gibbon to repay me ten dollars which he borrowed of me the
      other day,&rdquo; returned Stark, glibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;liar!&rdquo; exclaimed Gibbon, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared for this man&rsquo;s abuse,&rdquo; said Stark. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting
      now that a few days since he invited me to join him in the robbery of the
      safe. I threatened to inform you of his plan, and he promised to give it
      up. I supposed he had done so, but it is clear to me now that he carried
      out his infamous scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked amused. He admired Stark&rsquo;s brazen effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say to this charge, Mr. Gibbon?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this, sir, that I was concerned in the burglary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admits it!&rdquo; said Stark, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this man forced me to it. He threatened to write you some particulars
      of my past history which would probably have lost me my position if I did
      not agree to join him in the conspiracy. I was weak, and yielded. Now he
      is ready to betray me to save himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jennings,&rdquo; said Stark, coldly, &ldquo;you will know what importance to
      attach to the story of a self-confessed burglar. Gibbon, I hope you will
      see the error of your ways, and restore to your worthy employer the box of
      valuable property which you stole from his safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is insufferable!&rdquo; cried the bookkeeper &ldquo;You are a double-dyed
      traitor, Phil Stark. You were not only my accomplice, but you instigated
      the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find it hard to prove this,&rdquo; sneered Stark. &ldquo;Mr. Jennings, I
      demand my liberty. If you have any humanity you will not keep me from the
      bedside of my dying mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;I admire your audacity, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; observed
      the manufacturer, quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that I give the
      least credit to your statements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Gibbon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to accept the consequences of my
      act, but I don&rsquo;t want that scoundrel and traitor to go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove anything against me,&rdquo; said Stark, doggedly, &ldquo;unless you
      accept the word of a self-confessed burglar, who is angry with me because
      I would not join him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these protestations it would be better for you to keep till your
      trial begins, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; said the manufacturer. &ldquo;However, I think it only
      fair to tell you that I am better informed about you and your conspiracy
      than you imagine. Will you tell me where you were at eleven o&rsquo;clock last
      evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in my room at the hotel&mdash;no, I was taking a walk. I had
      received news of my mother&rsquo;s illness, and I was so much disturbed and
      grieved that I could not remain indoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were seen to enter the office of this factory with Mr. Gibbon, and
      after ten minutes came out with the tin box under your arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who saw me?&rdquo; demanded Stark, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Crawford came forward and answered this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A likely story! You were in bed and asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I was on watch behind the stone wall just opposite. If
      you want proof, I can repeat some of the conversation that passed between
      you and Mr. Gibbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for the request, Carl rehearsed some of the talk already
      recorded in a previous chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Stark began to see that things were getting serious for him, but he
      was game to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it,&rdquo; he said, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you also deny it, Mr. Gibbon?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I admit it,&rdquo; replied Gibbon, with a triumphant glance at his
      foiled confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a conspiracy against an innocent man,&rdquo; said Stark, scowling. &ldquo;You
      want to screen your bookkeeper, if possible. No one has ever before
      charged me with crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how does it happen, Mr. Stark, that you were confined at the Joliet
      penitentiary for a term of years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you this?&rdquo; snarled Stark, pointing to Gibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A customer of mine from Chicago. He saw you at the hotel, and informed
      Carl last evening of your character. Carl, of course, brought the news to
      me. It was in consequence of this information that I myself removed the
      bonds from the box, early in the evening, and substituted strips of paper.
      Your enterprise, therefore, would have availed you little even if you had
      succeeded in getting off scot-free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the game is up,&rdquo; said Stark, throwing off the mask. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that
      I have been in the Joliet penitentiary. It was there that I became
      acquainted with your bookkeeper,&rdquo; he added, maliciously. &ldquo;Let him deny it
      if he dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not deny it. It is true,&rdquo; said Gibbon. &ldquo;But I had resolved to
      live an honest life in future, and would have done so if this man had not
      pressed me into crime by his threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, Mr. Gibbon,&rdquo; said the manufacturer, gently, &ldquo;and I will
      see that this is counted in your favor. And now, gentlemen, I think there
      is no occasion for further delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were carried to the lockup and in due time were tried. Stark
      was sentenced to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, Gibbon to five. At the end of
      two years, at the intercession of Mr. Jennings, he was pardoned, and
      furnished with money enough to go to Australia, where, his past character
      unknown, he was able to make an honest living, and gain a creditable
      position.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AFTER A YEAR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Twelve months passed without any special incident. With Carl it was a
      period of steady and intelligent labor and progress. He had excellent
      mechanical talent, and made remarkable advancement. He was not content
      with attention to his own work, but was a careful observer of the work of
      others, so that in one year he learned as much of the business as most
      boys would have done in three.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the year was up, Mr. Jennings detained him after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what anniversary this is, Carl?&rdquo; he asked, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; it is the anniversary of my going into the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. How are you satisfied with the year and its work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been contented and happy, Mr. Jennings; and I feel that I owe my
      happiness and content to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you say so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is only fair to add that your own
      industry and intelligence have much to do with the satisfactory results of
      the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The superintendent tells me that outside of your own work you have a
      general knowledge of the business which would make you a valuable
      assistant to himself in case he needed one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl&rsquo;s face glowed with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in being thorough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am interested in every
      department of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you went into the factory you had not done any work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I had attended school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not a bad preparation for business, but in some cases it gives a
      boy disinclination for manual labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I wouldn&rsquo;t care to work with my hands all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for that. You have qualified yourself for something
      better. How much do I pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began on two dollars a week and my board. At the end of six months you
      kindly advanced me to four dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you have found it none too much for your wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved forty dollars out of it,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings looked pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done admirably,&rdquo; he said, warmly. &ldquo;Forty dollars is not a large
      sum, but in laying it by you have formed a habit that will be of great
      service to you in after years. I propose to raise you to ten dollars a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, shall I earn so much? You are very kind, but I am afraid you
      will be a loser by your liberality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are partly right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your services at present are hardly
      worth the sum I have agreed to pay, that is, in the factory, but I shall
      probably impose upon you other duties of an important nature soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, sir, I will endeavor to meet your expectations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to take a journey Carl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of sending you&mdash;to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl, who had thought perhaps of a fifty-mile trip, looked amazed, but his
      delight was equal to his surprise. He had always wished to see the West,
      though Chicago can hardly be called a Western city now, since between it
      and the Pacific there is a broad belt of land two thousand miles in
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am competent?&rdquo; he asked, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say positively, but I think so,&rdquo; answered Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be delighted to go. Will it be very soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very soon. I shall want you to start next Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be ready, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I may as well explain what are to be your duties. I am, as you know,
      manufacturing a special line of chairs which I am desirous of introducing
      to the trade. I shall give you the names of men in my line in Albany,
      Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago, and it will be your duty to call upon
      them, explain the merits of the chair, and solicit orders. In other words,
      you will be a traveling salesman or drummer. I shall pay your traveling
      expenses, ten dollars a week, and, if your orders exceed a certain limit,
      I shall give you a commission on the surplus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t reach that limit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall at all events feel that you have done your best. I will instruct
      you a little in your duties between now and the time of your departure. I
      should myself like to go in your stead, but I am needed here. There are,
      of course, others in my employ, older than yourself, whom I might send,
      but I have an idea that you will prove to be a good salesman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to be, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning Carl left Milford, reached New York in two hours and a
      half and, in accordance with the directions of Mr. Jennings, engaged
      passage and a stateroom on one of the palatial night lines of Hudson River
      steamers to Albany. The boat was well filled with passengers, and a few
      persons were unable to procure staterooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl, however, applied in time, and obtained an excellent room. He
      deposited his gripsack therein, and then took a seat on deck, meaning to
      enjoy as long as possible the delightful scenery for which the Hudson is
      celebrated. It was his first long journey, and for this reason Carl
      enjoyed it all the more. He could not but contrast his present position
      and prospects with those of a year ago, when, helpless and penniless, he
      left an unhappy home to make his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful evening!&rdquo; said a voice at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, Carl saw sitting by him a young man of about thirty, dressed in
      somewhat pretentious style and wearing eyeglasses. He was tall and thin,
      and had sandy side whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a beautiful evening,&rdquo; replied Carl, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the scenery is quite charming. Have you ever been all the way up the
      river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I hope some day to take a day trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. I am not sure but I prefer the Rhine, with its romantic castles
      and vineclad hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you visited Europe, then?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, several times. I have a passion for traveling. Our family is
      wealthy, and I have been able to go where I pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be very pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. My name is Stuyvesant&mdash;one of the old Dutch families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was not so much impressed, perhaps, as he should have been by this
      announcement, for he knew very little of fashionable life in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like a Dutchman,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you expected a figure like a beer keg,&rdquo; rejoined Stuyvesant,
      laughing. &ldquo;Some of my forefathers may have answered that description, but
      I am not built that way. Are you traveling far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may go as far as Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anyone with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have friends in Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I am aware of. I am traveling on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed; you are rather young for a business man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that cannot exactly be called venerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, did you succeed in getting a stateroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have a very good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, on my word. I was just too late. The man ahead of me took
      the last room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get a berth, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is so common. Really, I should not know how to travel without a
      stateroom. Have you anyone with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take me in I will pay the entire expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl hesitated. He preferred to be alone, but he was of an obliging
      disposition, and he knew that there were two berths in the stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it will be an accommodation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will let you occupy the room
      with me, Mr. Stuyvesant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, indeed! I shall esteem it a very great favor. Where is your
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl led the way to No. 17, followed by his new acquaintance. Mr.
      Stuyvesant seemed very much pleased, and insisted on paying for the room
      at once. Carl accepted half the regular charges, and so the bargain was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock the two travelers retired to bed. Carl was tired and went
      to sleep at once. He slept through the night. When he awoke in the morning
      the boat was in dock. He heard voices in the cabin, and the noise of the
      transfer of baggage and freight to the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have overslept myself,&rdquo; he said, and jumped up, hurriedly. He looked
      into the upper berth, but his roommate was gone. Something else was gone,
      too&mdash;his valise, and a wallet which he had carried in the pocket of
      his trousers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LOST BANK BOOK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl was not long in concluding that he had been robbed by his roommate.
      It was hard to believe that a Stuyvesant&mdash;a representative of one of
      the old Dutch families of New Amsterdam&mdash;should have stooped to such
      a discreditable act. Carl was sharp enough, however, to doubt the
      genuineness of Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s claims to aristocratic lineage. Meanwhile
      he blamed himself for being so easily duped by an artful adventurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, it was not as bad as it might be. His pocketbook only
      contained ten dollars in small bills. The balance of his money he had
      deposited for safe keeping in the inside pocket of his vest. This he had
      placed under his pillow, and so it had escaped the notice of the thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The satchel contained a supply of shirts, underclothing, etc., and he was
      sorry to lose it. The articles were not expensive, but it would cost him
      from a dozen to fifteen dollars to replace them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl stepped to the door of his stateroom and called a servant who was
      standing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have we been at the pier?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty minutes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see my roommate go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tall young man in a light overcoat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice whether he carried a valise in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gripsack? Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, sir! And such a respectable-lookin&rsquo; gemman, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have looked respectable, but he was a thief all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say? Did he take anything else, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took my pocketbook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! He was a rascal, sure! But maybe it dropped on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl turned his attention to the carpet, but saw nothing of the lost
      pocketbook. He did find, however, a small book in a brown cover, which
      Stuyvesant had probably dropped. Picking it up, he discovered that it was
      a bank book on the Sixpenny Savings Bank of Albany, standing in the name
      of Rachel Norris, and numbered 17,310.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is stolen property, too,&rdquo; thought Carl. &ldquo;I wonder if there is much
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Opening the book he saw that there were three entries, as follows:

     1883. Jan. 23. Five hundred dollars.
      &ldquo;    June 10. Two hundred dollars.
      &ldquo;    Oct. 21. One hundred dollars.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was besides this interest credited to the amount of seventy-five
      dollars. The deposits, therefore, made a grand total of $875.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt Mr. Stuyvesant had stolen this book, but had not as yet found an
      opportunity of utilizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s dat?&rdquo; asked the colored servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A savings bank book. My roommate must have dropped it. It appears to
      belong to a lady named Rachel Norris. I wish I could get it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she an Albany lady, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might look in the directory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will. It is a good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the gemman didn&rsquo;t take all your money, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he didn&rsquo;t even take half of it. I only wish I had been awake when the
      boat got to the dock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have called you, sir, if you had asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not much used to traveling. I shall know better next time what to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The finding of the bank book partially consoled Carl for the loss of his
      pocketbook and gripsack. He was glad to be able to defeat Stuyvesant in
      one of his nefarious schemes, and to be the instrument of returning Miss
      Norris her savings bank book.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left the boat he walked along till he reached a modest-looking
      hotel, where he thought the charges would be reasonable. He entered, and,
      going to the desk, asked if he could have a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large or small?&rdquo; inquired the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 67. Will you go up now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any baggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I had it stolen on the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk looked a little suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must require pay in advance, then,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Carl, pulling out a roll of bills. &ldquo;I suppose you
      make special terms to commercial travelers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a drummer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I represent Henry Jennings, of Milford, New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir. Our usual rates are two dollars a day. To you they will
      be a dollar and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will pay you for two days. Is breakfast ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is on the table, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will go in at once. I will go to my room afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his loss, Carl had a hearty appetite, and did justice to the
      comfortable breakfast provided. He bought a morning paper, and ran his eye
      over the advertising columns. He had never before read an Albany paper,
      and wished to get an idea of the city in its business aspect. It occurred
      to him that there might be an advertisement of the lost bank book. But no
      such notice met his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his room, which was small and plainly furnished, but looked
      comfortable. Going down again to the office, he looked into the Albany
      directory to see if he could find the name of Rachel Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Rebecca Norris, who was put down as a dressmaker, but that was
      as near as he came to Rachel Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he set himself to looking over the other members of the Norris
      family. Finally he picked out Norris &amp; Wade, furnishing goods, and
      decided to call at the store and inquire if they knew any lady named
      Rachel Norris. The prospect of gaining information in this way did not
      seem very promising, but no other course presented itself, and Carl
      determined to follow up the clew, slight as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though unacquainted with Albany streets, he had little difficulty in
      finding the store of Norris &amp; Wade. It was an establishment of good
      size, well supplied with attractive goods. A clerk came forward to wait
      upon Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I show you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may show me Mr. Norris, if you please,&rdquo; responded Carl, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in the office,&rdquo; said the clerk, with an answering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl entered the office and saw Mr. Norris, a man of middle age, partially
      bald, with a genial, business-like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man?&rdquo; he said, looking at Carl inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me for troubling you, sir,&rdquo; said Carl, who was afraid Mr.
      Norris would laugh at him, &ldquo;but I thought you might direct me to Rachel
      Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norris looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of Rachel Norris?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a little business with her,&rdquo; answered Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but I don&rsquo;t care to mention it at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! you are very cautious for a young man, or rather boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a good trait, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, but unusual. Are you a schoolboy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I am a drummer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norris put on a pair of glasses and scrutinized Carl more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see&mdash;just out of curiosity&mdash;the man that you
      travel for,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask him to call whenever he visits Albany. There is his card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norris took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is Henry Jennings, an old
      schoolmate of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good business man, even if he has sent out such a young drummer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. There must be something in you, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have
      trusted you. How is Jennings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is well, sir&mdash;well and prosperous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good news. Are you in his employ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. This is the first time I have traveled for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you can have to do with Rachel Norris. However, I don&rsquo;t
      mind telling you that she is my aunt, and&mdash;well, upon my soul! Here
      she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he ran hastily to greet a tall, thin lady, wearing a black shawl, who
      at that moment entered the office.

      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ECCENTRIC WOMAN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Norris dropped into a chair as if she were fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Rachel, how are you feeling this morning?&rdquo; asked her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of sorts,&rdquo; was the laconic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry for that. I suppose there is reason for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve been robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Norris. &ldquo;Lost your purse? I wonder more ladies are not
      robbed, carrying their money as carelessly as they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t it. I am always careful, as careful as any man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still you got robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but of a bank book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Carl became attentive. It was clear that he would not have to look
      any farther for the owner of the book he had found in his stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a bank book?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had nearly a thousand dollars deposited in the Sixpenny Savings Bank. I
      called at the bank to make some inquiries about interest, and when I came
      out I presume some rascal followed me and stole the book&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea who took it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got into the horse cars, near the bank; next to me sat a young man in a
      light overcoat. There was no one on the other side of me. I think he must
      have taken it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Stuyvesant,&rdquo; said Carl to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did this happen, Aunt Rachel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you do something about it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. I advertised a reward of twenty-five dollars to anyone who would
      restore it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no occasion for that. By giving notice at the bank, they would
      give you a new book after a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I preferred to recover the old one. Besides, I thought I would like to
      know what became of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, Miss Norris,&rdquo; said Carl, who thought it time to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Miss Norris had not seemed aware of Carl&rsquo;s presence. She turned
      abruptly and surveyed him through her glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might seem rude, but it was only Miss Rachel&rsquo;s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Norris, but I hope you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! that depends. You say you know what became of my bank book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was taken by the young man who sat next to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He robbed me last night on the way from New York in a Hudson River
      steamboat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t prove that he robbed me. I was robbed here in this city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to this?&rdquo; asked Carl, displaying the bank book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! That is my book. Where did you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl told his story briefly, how, on discovering that he had been robbed,
      he explored the stateroom and found the bank book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I am astonished! And how did you know Mr. Norris was my
      nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about him or you, but finding his
      name in the directory, I came here to ask if he knew any such person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a smart boy, and a good, honest one,&rdquo; said Miss Norris. &ldquo;You have
      earned the reward, and shall have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any reward, Miss Norris,&rdquo; rejoined Carl. &ldquo;I have had very
      little trouble in finding you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is of no consequence. I offered the reward, and Rachel Norris is a
      woman of her word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thrust her hand into her pocket, and drew out a wallet, more suitable
      to a man&rsquo;s use. Openings this, she took out three bills, two tens and a
      five, and extended them toward Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ought to take this money, Miss Norris,&rdquo; said Carl,
      reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did that rascal rob you, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of how much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars in money and some underclothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! This money will go toward making up your loss. You are not
      rich, I take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, and can afford to give you this money. There, take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask one favor of you. If you ever come across that young man in
      the light overcoat, have him arrested, and let me know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Miss Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live in Albany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl explained that he was traveling on business, and should leave the
      next day if he could get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you attend to some business for me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if it won&rsquo;t take too long a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Come round to my house to supper at six o&rsquo;clock, and I will tell
      you about it. Henry, write my address on a piece of paper, and give it to
      this young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Norris smiled, and did as his aunt requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have considerable confidence in this young man?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rachel Norris is not often mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept your invitation with pleasure, Miss Norris,&rdquo; said Carl,
      bowing politely. &ldquo;Now, as I have some business to attend to, I will bid
      you both good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Carl went out, Miss Norris said: &ldquo;Henry, that is a remarkable boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think favorably of him myself. He is in the employ of an old schoolmate
      of mine, Henry Jennings, of Milford. By the way, what business are you
      going to put into his hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man who has a shoe store on State Street has asked me for a loan
      of two thousand dollars to extend his business. His name is John French,
      and his mother was an old schoolmate of mine, though some years younger.
      Now I know nothing of him. If he is a sober, steady, industrious young
      man, I may comply with his request. This boy will investigate and report
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be guided by his report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Rachel, you are certainly very eccentric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be, but I am not often deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you won&rsquo;t be this time. The boy seems to me a very good boy,
      but you can&rsquo;t put an old head on young shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some boys have more sense than men twice their age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean me, I hope, Aunt Rachel,&rdquo; said Mr. Norris, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t. I shall not flatter you by speaking of you as only twice
      this boy&rsquo;s age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Aunt Rachel, there is no getting the better of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Carl was making business calls. He obtained a map of the city,
      and located the different firms on which he proposed to call. He had been
      furnished with a list by Mr. Jennings. He was everywhere pleasantly
      received&mdash;in some places with an expression of surprise at his youth&mdash;but
      when he began to talk he proved to be so well informed upon the subject of
      his call that any prejudice excited by his age quickly vanished. He had
      the satisfaction of securing several unexpectedly large orders for the
      chair, and transmitting them to Mr. Jennings by the afternoon mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got through his business at four o&rsquo;clock, and rested for an hour or
      more at his hotel. Then he arranged his toilet, and set out for the
      residence of Miss Rachel Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather a prim-looking, three-story house, such as might be supposed
      to belong to a maiden lady. He was ushered into a sitting-room on the
      second floor, where Miss Norris soon joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, my young friend,&rdquo; she said, cordially. &ldquo;You are in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always try to be, Miss Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good way to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper is ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Follow me downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl followed the old lady to the rear room on the lower floor. A small
      table was set in the center of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat opposite me,&rdquo; said Miss Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two other chairs, one on each side&mdash;Carl wondered for whom
      they were set. No sooner were he and Miss Norris seated than two large
      cats approached the table, and jumped up, one into each chair. Carl looked
      to see them ordered away, but instead, Miss Norris nodded pleasantly,
      saying: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jane and Molly, you are punctual at meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two cats eyed their mistress gravely, and began to purr contentedly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL TAKES SUPPER WITH MISS NORRIS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my family,&rdquo; said Miss Norris, pointing to the cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like cats,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; returned Miss Norris, looking pleased. &ldquo;Most boys tease them. Do
      you see poor Molly&rsquo;s ear? That wound came from a stone thrown by a bad
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many boys are cruel,&rdquo; said Carl, &ldquo;but I remember that my mother was very
      fond of cats, and I have always protected them from abuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stroked Molly, who purred an acknowledgment of his
      attention. This completed the conquest of Miss Norris, who inwardly
      decided that Carl was the finest boy she had ever met. After she had
      served Carl from the dishes on the table, she poured out two saucers of
      milk and set one before each cat, who, rising upon her hind legs, placed
      her forepaws on the table, and gravely partook of the refreshments
      provided. Jane and Molly were afterwards regaled with cold meat, and then,
      stretching themselves out on their chairs, closed their eyes in placid
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the meal Miss Norris questioned Carl closely as to his home
      experiences. Having no reason for concealment Carl frankly related his
      troubles with his stepmother, eliciting expressions of sympathy and
      approval from his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your stepmother must be an ugly creature?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am prejudiced against her,&rdquo; said Carl, &ldquo;but that is my
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father must be very weak to be influenced against his own son by
      such a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl winced a little at this outspoken criticism, for he was attached to
      his father in spite of his unjust treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is an invalid,&rdquo; he said, apologetically, &ldquo;and I think he
      yielded for the sake of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, he ought not to do it,&rdquo; said Miss Norris. &ldquo;Do you ever
      expect to live at home again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while my stepmother is there,&rdquo; answered Carl. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that
      I should care to do so under any circumstances, as I am now receiving a
      business training. I should like to make a little visit home,&rdquo; he added,
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;and perhaps I may do so after I return from Chicago. I
      shall have no favors to ask, and shall feel independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever need a home,&rdquo; said Miss Norris, abruptly, &ldquo;come here. You
      will be welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Carl, gratefully. &ldquo;It is all the more kind in
      you since you have known me so short a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known you long enough to judge of you,&rdquo; said the maiden lady. &ldquo;And
      now if you won&rsquo;t have anything more we will go into the next room and talk
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl followed her into the adjoining room, and Miss Norris at once plunged
      into the subject. She handed him a business card bearing this inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN FRENCH, BOOTS, SHOES AND RUBBER GOODS, 42a State Street, CHICAGO.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man wants me to lend him two thousand dollars to extend his
      business,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is the son of an old school friend, and I am
      willing to oblige him if he is a sober, steady and economical business
      man. I want you to find out whether this is the case and report to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be difficult?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid to undertake anything that is difficult?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Carl, with a smile. &ldquo;I was only afraid I might not do the
      work satisfactorily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give you no instructions,&rdquo; said Miss Norris. &ldquo;I shall trust to
      your good judgment. I will give you a letter to Mr. French, which you can
      use or not, as you think wise. Of course, I shall see that you are paid
      for your trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;I hope my services may be worth compensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you are situated as to money, but I can give you some in
      advance,&rdquo; and the old lady opened her pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Miss Norris; I shall not need it. I might have been short
      if you had not kindly paid me a reward for a slight service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slight, indeed! If you had lost a bank book like mine you would be glad
      to get it back at such a price. If you will catch the rascal who stole it
      I will gladly pay you as much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might for my own sake, but I am afraid it would be too late to
      recover my money and clothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At an early hour Carl left the house, promising to write to Miss Norris
      from Chicago.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A STARTLING DISCOVERY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Carl, as he left the house where he had been so hospitably
      entertained, &ldquo;I shall not lack for business. Miss Norris seems to have a
      great deal of confidence in me, considering that I am a stranger. I will
      take care that she does not repent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give a poor man enough money to buy a cheap meal?&rdquo; asked a
      plaintive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl scanned the applicant for charity closely. He was a man of medium
      size, with a pair of small eyes, and a turnup nose. His dress was
      extremely shabby, and he had the appearance of one who was on bad terms
      with fortune. There was nothing striking about his appearance, yet Carl
      regarded him with surprise and wonder. Despite the difference in age, he
      bore a remarkable resemblance to his stepbrother, Peter Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten anything for twenty-four hours,&rdquo; continued the tramp, as
      he may properly be called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard world to such as me, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should judge so from your looks,&rdquo; answered Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you are right. I was born to ill luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl had some doubts about this. Those who represent themselves as born to
      ill luck can usually trace the ill luck to errors or shortcomings of their
      own. There are doubtless inequalities of fortune, but not as great as many
      like to represent. Of two boys who start alike one may succeed, and the
      other fail, but in nine cases out of ten the success or failure may be
      traced to a difference in the qualities of the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a quarter if that will do you any good,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man clutched at it with avidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. This will buy me a cup of coffee and a plate of meat, and will
      put new life into me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to hurry away, but Carl felt like questioning him further.
      The extraordinary resemblance between this man and his stepbrother led him
      to think it possible that there might be a relationship between them. Of
      his stepmother&rsquo;s family he knew little or nothing. His father had married
      her on short acquaintance, and she was very reticent about her former
      life. His father was indolent, and had not troubled himself to make
      inquiries. He took her on her own representation as the widow of a
      merchant who had failed in business.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the impulse of the moment&mdash;an impulse which he could not explain&mdash;Carl
      asked abruptly&mdash;&ldquo;Is your name Cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of surprise, almost of stupefaction, appeared on the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you my name?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your name is Cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your object in asking?&rdquo; said the man, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you no harm,&rdquo; returned Carl, &ldquo;but I have reasons for asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see me before?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what makes you think my name is Cook? It is not written on my face,
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a boy named Peter Cook,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who resembles you very
      strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Peter Cook&mdash;little Peter?&rdquo; exclaimed the tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is he a relation of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; responded Cook, emphatically. &ldquo;He is my own son&mdash;that
      is, if he is a boy of about your age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Is his mother alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; exclaimed Carl, overwhelmed at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was my wife!&rdquo; said Cook, &ldquo;but while I was in California, some years
      since, she took possession of my small property, procured a divorce
      through an unprincipled lawyer, and I returned to find myself without
      wife, child or money. Wasn&rsquo;t that a mean trick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me where she is?&rdquo; asked Cook, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I find my wife?&rdquo; asked Cook, with much eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl hesitated. He did not like his stepmother; he felt that she had
      treated him meanly, but he was not prepared to reveal her present
      residence till he knew what course Cook intended to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is married again,&rdquo; he said, watching Cook to see what effect this
      announcement might have upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objection, I am sure,&rdquo; responded Cook, indifferently. &ldquo;Did she
      marry well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She married a man in good circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would take good care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t intend to reclaim her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? She obtained a divorce, though by false representations. I am
      glad to be rid of her, but I want her to restore the two thousand dollars
      of which she robbed me. I left my property in her hands, but when she
      ceased to be my wife she had no right to take possession of it. I ought
      not to be surprised, however. It wasn&rsquo;t the first theft she had
      committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; asked Carl, excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I married her without knowing much of her antecedents. Two years
      after marriage I ascertained that she had served a year&rsquo;s term of
      imprisonment for a theft of jewelry from a lady with whom she was living
      as housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. She was recognized by a friend of mine, who had been an
      official at the prison. When taxed with it by me she admitted it, but
      claimed that she was innocent. I succeeded in finding a narrative of the
      trial in an old file of papers, and came to the conclusion that she was
      justly convicted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I proposed separation, but she begged me to keep the thing secret, and
      let ourselves remain the same as before. I agreed out of consideration for
      her, but had occasion to regret it. My business becoming slack, I decided
      to go to California in the hope of acquiring a competence. I was not
      fortunate there, and was barely able, after a year, to get home. I found
      that my wife had procured a divorce, and appropriated the little money I
      had left. Where she had gone, or where she had conveyed our son, I could
      not learn. You say you know where she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cook,&rdquo; said Carl, after a pause for reflection, &ldquo;I will tell you, but
      not just at present. I am on my way to Chicago on business. On my return I
      will stop here, and take you with me to the present home of your former
      wife. You will understand my interest in the matter when I tell you that
      she is now married to a relative of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity him whoever he is,&rdquo; said Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he is to be pitied,&rdquo; said Carl, gravely; &ldquo;but the revelation
      you will be able to make will enable him to insist upon a separation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing he can do! How long before you return to Albany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week or ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I am to live in the meantime,&rdquo; said Cook, anxiously. &ldquo;I
      am penniless, but for the money you have just given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what price can you obtain board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of a decent house where I can obtain board and a small room for
      five dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are twelve dollars. This will pay for two weeks&rsquo; board, and give you
      a small sum besides. What is the address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cook mentioned a number on a street by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl took it down in a notebook with which he had provided himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I return to Albany,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will call there at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall be even more anxious to meet you than you will be to meet me.
      The one to whom your former wife is married is very near and dear to me,
      and I cannot bear to think that he has been so wronged and imposed upon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir! I shall wait for you with confidence. If I can get back
      from my former wife the money she robbed me of, I can get on my feet
      again, and take a respectable position in society. It is very hard for a
      man dressed as I am to obtain any employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his shabby and ragged suit, Carl could readily believe this
      statement. If he had wished to employ anyone he would hardly have been
      tempted to engage a man so discreditable in appearance. &ldquo;Be of good
      courage, Mr. Cook,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;If your story is correct, and I
      believe it is, there are better days in store for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for those words,&rdquo; said Cook, earnestly. &ldquo;They give me new
      hope.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FROM ALBANY TO NIAGARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carl took the afternoon train on the following day for Buffalo. His
      thoughts were busy with the startling discovery he had made in regard to
      his stepmother. Though he had never liked her, he had been far from
      imagining that she was under the ban of the law. It made him angry to
      think that his father had been drawn into a marriage with such a woman&mdash;that
      the place of his idolized mother had been taken by one who had served a
      term at Sing Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Peter know of his mother&rsquo;s past disgrace? he asked himself. Probably
      not, for it had come before his birth. He only wondered that the secret
      had never got out before. There must be many persons who had known her as
      a prisoner, and could identify her now. She had certainly been fortunate
      with the fear of discovery always haunting her. Carl could not understand
      how she could carry her head so high, and attempt to tyrannize over his
      father and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the result would be when Dr. Crawford learned the antecedents of the
      woman whom he called wife Carl did not for a moment doubt. His father was
      a man of very strict ideas on the subject of honor, and good repute, and
      the discovery would lead him to turn from Mrs. Crawford in abhorrence.
      Moreover, he was strongly opposed to divorce, and Carl had heard him argue
      that a divorced person should not be permitted to remarry. Yet in
      ignorance he had married a divorced woman, who had been convicted of
      theft, and served a term of imprisonment. The discovery would be a great
      shock to him, and it would lead to a separation and restore the cordial
      relations between himself and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after his settlement in Milford; Carl had written as follows to
      his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Father:&mdash;Though I felt obliged to leave home for reasons which
      we both understand, I am sure that you will feel interested to know how I
      am getting along. I did not realize till I had started out how difficult
      it is for a boy, brought up like myself, to support himself when thrown
      upon his own exertions. A newsboy can generally earn enough money to
      maintain himself in the style to which he is accustomed, but I have had a
      comfortable and even luxurious home, and could hardly bring myself to live
      in a tenement house, or a very cheap boarding place. Yet I would rather do
      either than stay in a home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of
      one member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not take up your time by relating the incidents of the first two
      days after I left home. I came near getting into serious trouble through
      no fault of my own, but happily escaped. When I was nearly penniless I
      fell in with a prosperous manufacturer of furniture who has taken me into
      his employment. He gives me a home in his own house, and pays me two
      dollars a week besides. This is enough to support me economically, and I
      shall after a while receive better pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the office, but in the factory, and am learning the business
      practically, starting in at the bottom. I think I have a taste for it, and
      the superintendent tells me I am making remarkable progress. The time was
      when I would have hesitated to become a working boy, but I have quite got
      over such foolishness. Mr. Jennings, my employer, who is considered a rich
      man, began as I did, and I hope some day to occupy a position similar to
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you are quite well and happy, dear father. My only regret is,
      that I cannot see you occasionally. While my stepmother and Peter form
      part of your family, I feel that I can never live at home. They both
      dislike me, and I am afraid I return the feeling. If you are sick or need
      me, do not fail to send for me, for I can never forget that you are my
      father, as I am your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was handed to Dr. Crawford at the breakfast table. He colored
      and looked agitated when he opened the envelope, and Mrs. Crawford, who
      had a large share of curiosity, did not fail to notice this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom is your letter, my dear?&rdquo; she asked, in the soft tone which was
      habitual with her when she addressed her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handwriting is Carl&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Dr. Crawford, already devouring the
      letter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she answered, in a chilly tone. &ldquo;I have been expecting you would
      hear from him. How much money does he send for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not finished the letter.&rdquo; Dr. Crawford continued reading. When he
      had finished he laid it down beside his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said his wife, interrogatively. &ldquo;What does he have to say? Does he
      ask leave to come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is quite content where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Milford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not far away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not more than sixty miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he ask for money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a furniture factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a factory boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is learning the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very ambitious,&rdquo; sneered Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, he is looking forward to being in business for himself
      some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your money&mdash;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Crawford, you do the boy injustice. He hints nothing of the
      kind. He evidently means to raise himself gradually as his employer did
      before him. By the way, he has a home in his employer&rsquo;s family. I think
      Mr. Jennings must have taken a fancy to Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will find him more agreeable than I did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you always treated Carl considerately, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t flatter or fondle him, if that is what you mean. I treated him
      as well as he could expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you treat him as well as Peter, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There is a great difference between the two boys. Peter is always
      respectful and obliging, and doesn&rsquo;t set up his will against mine. He
      never gives me a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will continue to find him a comfort, my dear,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Crawford, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across the table at the fat, expressionless face of his stepson,
      and he blamed himself because he could not entertain a warmer regard for
      Peter. Somehow he had a slight feeling of antipathy, which he tried to
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he is a good boy, since his mother says so,&rdquo; reflected the
      doctor, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t appreciate him. I will take care, however, that
      neither he nor his mother sees this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Peter heard his mother&rsquo;s encomium upon him, he laughed in his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remind ma of that when she scolds me,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
      Carl isn&rsquo;t coming back. He was always interferin&rsquo; with me. Now, if ma and
      I play our cards right we&rsquo;ll get all his father&rsquo;s money. Ma thinks he
      won&rsquo;t live long, I heard her say so the other day. Won&rsquo;t it be jolly for
      ma and me to come into a fortune, and live just as we please! I hope ma
      will go to New York. It&rsquo;s stupid here, but I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ll have to stay for
      the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Carl&rsquo;s letter private?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Crawford, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think he would rather I didn&rsquo;t show it,&rdquo; returned her husband,
      remembering the allusion made by Carl to his stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I am not curious,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, tossing her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      None the less, however, she resolved to see and read the letter, if she
      could get hold of it without her husband&rsquo;s knowledge. He was so careless
      that she did not doubt soon to find it laid down somewhere. In this she
      proved correct. Before the day was over, she found Carl&rsquo;s letter in her
      husband&rsquo;s desk. She opened and read it eagerly with a running fire of
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Reasons which we both understand,&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated, scornfully. &ldquo;That is a
      covert attack upon me. Of course, I ought to expect that. So he had a hard
      time. Well, it served him right for conducting himself as he did. Ah, here
      is another hit at me&mdash;&lsquo;Yet I would rather do either than live in a
      home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of one member.&rsquo; He is
      trying to set his father against me. Well, he won&rsquo;t succeed. I can twist
      Dr. Paul Crawford round my finger, luckily, and neither his son nor anyone
      else can diminish my influence over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read on for some time till she reached this passage: &ldquo;While my
      stepmother and Peter form a part of your family I can never live at home.
      They both dislike me, and I am afraid I return the feeling.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks for
      the information,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I knew it before. This letter doesn&rsquo;t
      make me feel any more friendly to you, Carl Crawford. I see that you are
      trying to ingratiate yourself with your father, and prejudice him against
      me and my poor Peter, but I think I can defeat your kind intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded up the letter, and replaced it in her husband&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if my husband will answer Carl&rsquo;s artful epistle,&rdquo; she said to
      herself. &ldquo;He can if he pleases. He is weak as water, and I will see that
      he goes no farther than words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford did answer Carl&rsquo;s letter. This is his reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Carl:&mdash;I am glad to hear that you are comfortably situated. I
      regret that you were so headstrong and unreasonable. It seems to me that
      you might, with a little effort, have got on with your stepmother. You
      could hardly expect her to treat you in the same way as her own son. He
      seems to be a good boy, but I own that I have never been able to become
      attached to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl read this part of the letter with satisfaction. He knew how mean and
      contemptible Peter was, and it would have gone to his heart to think that
      his father had transferred his affection to the boy he had so much reason
      to dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are pleased with your prospects. I think I could have done
      better for you had your relations with your stepmother been such as to
      make it pleasant for you to remain at home. You are right in thinking that
      I am interested in your welfare. I hope, my dear Carl, you will become a
      happy and prosperous man. I do not forget that you are my son, and I am
      still your affectionate father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was glad to receive this letter. It showed him that his stepmother
      had not yet succeeded in alienating from him his father&rsquo;s affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must return to the point where we left Carl on his journey to
      Buffalo. He enjoyed his trip over the Central road during the hours of
      daylight. He determined on his return to make an all-day trip so that he
      might enjoy the scenery through which he now rode in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Buffalo he had no other business except that of Mr. Jennings, and
      immediately after breakfast he began to make a tour of the furniture
      establishments. He met with excellent success, and had the satisfaction of
      sending home some large orders. In the evening he took train for Niagara,
      wishing to see the falls in the early morning, and resume his journey in
      the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He registered at the International Hotel on the American side. It was too
      late to do more than take an evening walk, and see the falls gleaming like
      silver through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to bed early,&rdquo; thought Carl, &ldquo;and get up at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did go to bed early, but he was more fatigued than he supposed, and
      slept longer than he anticipated. It was eight o&rsquo;clock before he came
      downstairs. Before going in to breakfast, he took a turn on the piazzas.
      Here he fell in with a sociable gentleman, much addicted to gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you seen the falls yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught a glimpse of them last evening I am going to visit them after
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a good many people staying here just now&mdash;some quite noted
      persons, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what do you say to an English lord?&rdquo; and Carl&rsquo;s new friend nodded
      with am important air, as if it reflected great credit on the hotel to
      have so important a guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he look different from anyone else?&rdquo; asked Carl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, he isn&rsquo;t much to look at,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;The
      gentleman who is with him looks more stylish. I thought he was the lord at
      first, but I afterwards learned that he was an American named Stuyvesant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl started at the familiar name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he tall and slender, with side whiskers, and does he wear eyeglasses?&rdquo;
       he asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you know him then?&rdquo; said the other, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Carl, with a smile, &ldquo;I am slightly acquainted with him. I
      am very anxious to meet him again.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CARL MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF AN ENGLISH LORD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are now,&rdquo; said the stranger, suddenly pointing out two persons
      walking slowly along the piazza. &ldquo;The small man, in the rough suit, and
      mutton-chop whiskers, is Lord Bedford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl eyed the British nobleman with some curiosity. Evidently Lord Bedford
      was no dude. His suit was of rough cloth and ill-fitting. He was barely
      five feet six inches in height, with features decidedly plain, but with an
      absence of pretension that was creditable to him, considering that he was
      really what he purported to be. Stuyvesant walked by his side, nearly a
      head taller, and of more distinguished bearing, though of plebeian
      extraction. His manner was exceedingly deferential, and he was praising
      England and everything English in a fulsome manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; Carl overheard him say, &ldquo;I have often thought that society
      in England is far superior to our American society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, you are very kind,&rdquo; drawled the nobleman, &ldquo;but really I find
      things very decent in America, upon my word. I had been reading Dickens&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Notes&rsquo; before I came over and I expected to find you very uncivilized,
      and&mdash;almost aboriginal; but I assure you I have met some very
      gentlemanly persons in America, some almost up to our English standard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my lord, such a tribute from a man in your position is most
      gratifying. May I state this on your authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t mind, but I would rather not get into the papers, don&rsquo;t you
      know. You are not a&mdash;reporter, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Mr. Stuyvesant, in a lofty tone. &ldquo;I am a scion of one
      of the oldest families in New York. Of course I know that social position
      is a very different thing here from what it is in England. It must be a
      gratifying thing to reflect that you are a lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. I never thought much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like so much to be a lord. I care little for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by Jove, you are a remarkable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In comparison with rank, I mean. I would rather be a lord with a thousand
      pounds a year than a rich merchant with ten times as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it very inconvenient being a lord on a thousand; you might as
      well be a beggar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, of course, high rank requires a large rent roll. In fact, a
      New York gentleman requires more than a trifle to support him. I can&rsquo;t
      dress on less than two hundred pounds a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your American tailors are high-priced, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those that I employ; we have cheap tailors, of course, but I generally go
      to Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stuyvesant was posing as a gentleman of fashion. Carl, who followed at
      a little distance behind the pair, was much amused by his remarks, knowing
      what he did about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a little of going to England in a few months,&rdquo; continued
      Stuyvesant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You must look me up,&rdquo; said Bedford, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, indeed, be delighted,&rdquo; said Stuyvesant, effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, if I am in England. I may be on the Continent, but you can
      inquire for me at my club&mdash;the Piccadilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall esteem it a great honor, my lord. I have a penchant for good
      society. The lower orders are not attractive to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are sometimes more interesting,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;but do you
      know, I am surprised to hear an American speak in this way. I thought you
      were all on a level here in a republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my lord!&rdquo; expostulated Stuyvesant, deprecatingly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I
      would associate with shopkeepers and common tradesmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. A cousin of mine is interested in a wine business in
      London. He is a younger son with a small fortune, and draws a very tidy
      income from his city business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his name doesn&rsquo;t appear on the sign, I infer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not. Then you are not in business, Mr. Stuyvesant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I inherited an income from my father. It isn&rsquo;t as large as I could
      wish, and I have abstained from marrying because I could not maintain the
      mode of living to which I have been accustomed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should marry a rich girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! I may do so, since your lordship recommends it. In fact, I have in
      view a young lady whose father was once lord mayor (I beg pardon, mayor)
      of New York. Her father is worth a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, dollars. I should have said two hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the girl is willing, it may be a good plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my lord. Your advice is very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man seems on very good terms with Lord Bedford,&rdquo; said Carl&rsquo;s
      companion, whose name was Atwood, with a shade of envy in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would introduce me,&rdquo; went on Mr. Atwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer the introduction of a different man,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? He seems to move in good society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without belonging to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I wish I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atwood looked curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain later,&rdquo; said Carl; &ldquo;now I must go in to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Stuyvesant had glanced at Carl, he did not appear to recognize him,
      partly, no doubt, because he had no expectation of meeting the boy he had
      robbed, at Niagara. Besides, his time and attention were so much taken up
      by his aristocratic acquaintance that he had little notice for anyone
      else. Carl observed with mingled amusement and vexation that Mr.
      Stuyvesant wore a new necktie, which he had bought for himself in New
      York, and which had been in the stolen gripsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can find Lord Bedford alone I will put him on his guard,&rdquo; thought
      Carl. &ldquo;I shall spoil Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Carl prepared to go down to the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way he overtook Lord Bedford walking in the same direction, and, as
      it happened, without a companion. Carl quickened his pace, and as he
      caught up with him, he raised his hat, and said: &ldquo;Lord Bedford, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Englishman, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize for addressing a stranger, but I want to put you on your
      guard against a young man whom I saw walking with you on the piazza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he&mdash;what do you know of him?&rdquo; asked Lord Bedford, laying aside
      his air of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he is an adventurer and a thief. I made his acquaintance on a
      Hudson River steamer, and he walked off with my valise and a small sum of
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; asked the Englishman, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. He is wearing one of my neckties at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The confounded cad!&rdquo; ejaculated the Englishman, angrily. &ldquo;I suppose he
      intended to rob me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it. That is why I ventured to put you on your guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a thousand times obliged to you. Why, the fellow told me he belonged
      to one of the best families in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, he doesn&rsquo;t do much credit to the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true! Why, he was praising everything English. He evidently wanted
      to gain my confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask where you met him?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the train. He offered me a light. Before I knew it, he was chatting
      familiarly with me. But his game is spoiled. I will let him know that I
      see through him and his designs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then my object is accomplished,&rdquo; said
      Carl. &ldquo;Please excuse my want of ceremony.&rdquo; He turned to leave, but Bedford
      called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to the falls, remain with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall enjoy
      it better in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure. Let me introduce myself as Carl Crawford. I am traveling
      on business and don&rsquo;t belong to one of the first families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you will suit me,&rdquo; said the Englishman, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then up came Stuyvesant, panting and breathless. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I lost sight of you. If you will allow me I will join you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the Englishman, in a freezing voice, &ldquo;I have not the honor of
      knowing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stuyvesant was overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope I have not offended you, my lord,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I have learned your character from this young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This called the attention of Stuyvesant to Carl. He flushed as he
      recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stuyvesant,&rdquo; said Carl, &ldquo;I must trouble you to return the valise you
      took from my stateroom, and the pocketbook which you borrowed. My name is
      Carl Crawford, and my room is 71.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stuyvesant turned away abruptly. He left the valise at the desk, but Carl
      never recovered his money.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT CARL LEARNED IN CHICAGO.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Carl walked back from the falls he met Mr. Atwood, who was surprised to
      find his young acquaintance on such intimate terms with Lord Bedford. He
      was about to pass with a bow, when Carl, who was good-natured, said:
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us, Mr. Atwood? If Lord Bedford will permit, I should like
      to introduce you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to know any friend of yours, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said the Englishman,
      affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel honored by the introduction,&rdquo; said Atwood, bowing profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not a friend of Mr.&mdash;ah, Mr. Stuyvesant,&rdquo; said the
      nobleman, &ldquo;the person I was talking with this morning. Mr. Crawford tells
      me he is a&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a confidence man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no acquaintance with him, my lord. I saw him just now leaving the
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he has gone away with my valise and money,&rdquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should be inconvenienced, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said the nobleman, &ldquo;my
      purse is at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, Lord Bedford,&rdquo; said Carl, gratefully. &ldquo;I am glad to
      say I am still fairly well provided with money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to make you the same offer, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said Atwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! I appreciate your kindness, even if I&rsquo;m not obliged to avail
      myself of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the hotel, Lord Bedford ordered a carriage, and invited
      Atwood and Carl to accompany him on a drive. Mr. Atwood was in an ecstasy,
      and anticipated with proud satisfaction telling his family of his intimate
      friend, Lord Bedford, of England. The peer, though rather an
      ordinary-looking man, seemed to him a model of aristocratic beauty. It was
      a weakness on the part of Mr. Atwood, but an amiable one, and is shared by
      many who live under republican institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Carl felt obliged to resume his journey. He had found his
      visit to Niagara very agreeable, but his was a business and not a pleasure
      trip, and loyalty to his employer required him to cut it short. Lord
      Bedford shook his hand heartily at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shall meet again, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expect, myself, to
      reach Chicago on Saturday, and shall be glad to have you call on me at the
      Palmer House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my lord; I will certainly inquire for you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very good fellow, even if he is a lord,&rdquo; thought Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young hero was a thorough American, and was disposed to think with
      Robert Burns, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;The rank is but the guinea, stamp;
    The man&rsquo;s the gold for a&rsquo; that!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      No incident worth recording befell Carl on his trip to Chicago. As a
      salesman he met with excellent success, and surprised Mr. Jennings by the
      size of his orders. He was led, on reaching Chicago, to register at the
      Sherman House, on Clark Street, one of the most reliable among the many
      houses for travelers offered by the great Western metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day he made it a point to find out the store of John French,
      hoping to acquire the information desired by Miss Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a store of good size, and apparently well stocked. Feeling the need
      of new footgear, Carl entered and asked to be shown some shoes. He was
      waited upon by a young clerk named Gray, with whom he struck up a pleasant
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live in Chicago?&rdquo; asked Gray? sociably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am from New York State. I am here on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Staying at a hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at the Sherman. If you are at leisure this evening I shall be glad
      to have you call on me. I am a stranger here, and likely to find the time
      hang heavy on my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be free at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come to supper with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I shall be glad to do so,&rdquo; answered Gray, with alacrity.
      Living as he did at a cheap boarding house, the prospect of a supper at a
      first-class hotel was very attractive. He was a pleasant-faced young man
      of twenty, who had drifted to Chicago from his country home in Indiana,
      and found it hard to make both ends meet on a salary of nine dollars a
      week. His habits were good, his manner was attractive and won him
      popularity with customer&rsquo;s, and with patience he was likely to succeed in
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could live like this every day,&rdquo; he said, as he rose from a
      luxurious supper. &ldquo;At present my finances won&rsquo;t allow me to board at the
      Sherman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would mine,&rdquo; said Carl; &ldquo;but I am allowed to spend money more freely
      when I am traveling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted in New York?&rdquo; asked Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little or no acquaintance in the city,&rdquo; answered Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to get a position there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not satisfied with your present place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not long keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Do you think you are in any danger of being discharged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that. I am afraid Mr. French will be obliged to give up
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Carl, with keen interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to think he is embarrassed. I know that he has a good many
      bills out, some of which have been running a long time. If any pressure is
      brought to bear upon him, he may have to suspend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl felt that he was obtaining important information. If Mr. French were
      in such a condition Miss Norris would be pretty sure to lose her money if
      she advanced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what do you attribute Mr. French&rsquo;s embarrassment?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives expensively in a handsome house near Lincoln Park, and draws
      heavily upon the business for his living expenses. I think that explains
      it. I only wonder that he has been able to hold out so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps if he were assisted he would be able to keep his head above
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would need a good deal of assistance. You see that my place isn&rsquo;t very
      secure, and I shall soon need to be looking up another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall need to inquire any farther,&rdquo; thought Carl. &ldquo;It
      seems to me Miss Norris had better keep her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he retired he indited the following letter to his Albany employer:
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rachel Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Madam:&mdash;I have attended to your commission, and have to report
      that Mr. French appears to be involved in business embarrassments, and in
      great danger to bankruptcy. The loan he asks of you would no doubt be of
      service, but probably would not long delay the crash. If you wish to
      assist him, it would be better to allow him to fail, and then advance him
      the money to put him on his feet. I am told that his troubles come from
      living beyond his means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By return mail Carl received the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Young Friend:&mdash;Your report confirms the confidence I reposed
      in you. It is just the information I desired. I shall take your advice and
      refuse the loan. What other action I may take hereafter I cannot tell.
      When you return, should you stop in Albany, please call on me. If unable
      to do this, write me from Milford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rachel Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl was detained for several days in Chicago. He chanced to meet his
      English friend, Lord Bedford, upon his arrival, and the nobleman, on
      learning where he was staying, also registered at the Sherman House. In
      his company Carl took a drive over the magnificent boulevard which is the
      pride of Chicago, and rose several degrees in the opinion of those guests
      who noticed his intimacy with the English guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl had just completed his Chicago business when, on entering the hotel,
      he was surprised to see a neighbor of his father&rsquo;s&mdash;Cyrus Robinson&mdash;a
      prominent business man of Edgewood Center. Carl was delighted, for he had
      not been home, or seen any home friends for over a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Mr. Robinson,&rdquo; he said, offering his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Carl Crawford!&rdquo; exclaimed Robinson, in amazement. &ldquo;How came you in
      Chicago? Your father did not tell me you were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know it. I am only here on a business visit. Tell me, Mr.
      Robinson, how is my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Carl, that he is not at all well. I am quite sure he misses you,
      and I don&rsquo;t believe your stepmother&rsquo;s influence over him is beneficial.
      Just before I came away I heard a rumor that troubled me. It is believed
      in Edgewood that she is trying to induce your father to make a will
      leaving all, or nearly all his property to her and her son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much for that, Mr. Robinson, as for my father&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl,&rdquo; said Robinson, significantly, &ldquo;if such a will is made I don&rsquo;t
      believe your father will live long after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rdquo; said Carl, horror-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mrs. Crawford, by artful means will worry your father to death.
      He is of a nervous temperament, and an unscrupulous woman can shorten his
      life without laying herself open to the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl&rsquo;s face grew stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save my father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and defeat my stepmother&rsquo;s wicked
      schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray Heaven you can. There is no time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lose no time, you may be sure. I shall be at Edgewood within a
      week.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MAKING A WILL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In Edgewood Center events moved slowly. In Carl Crawford&rsquo;s home dullness
      reigned supreme. He had been the life of the house, and his absence,
      though welcome to his stepmother, was seriously felt by his father, who
      day by day became thinner and weaker, while his step grew listless and his
      face seldom brightened with a smile. He was anxious to have Carl at home
      again, and the desire became so strong that he finally broached the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said one day at the breakfast table, &ldquo;I have been thinking
      of Carl considerably of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like to have him at home once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford smiled ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is better off where he is,&rdquo; she said, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is my only son, and I never see him,&rdquo; pleaded her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well, Dr. Crawford,&rdquo; rejoined his wife, &ldquo;that your son only
      made trouble in the house while he was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it seems hard that he should be driven from his father&rsquo;s home, and
      forced to take refuge among strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by his being driven from home,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Crawford, tossing her head. &ldquo;He made himself disagreeable, and, not being
      able to have his own way, he took French leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house seems very lonely without him,&rdquo; went on Dr. Crawford, who was
      too wise to get into an argument with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is more quiet. As for company, Peter is still here, and
      would at any time stay with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not relish this suggestion, and did not indorse it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not care to confine him to the house,&rdquo; said Dr. Crawford, as his
      glance rested on the plain and by no means agreeable face of his stepson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I need not speak of myself. You know that you can always call
      upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Dr. Crawford had been warmly attached to his second wife, this proposal
      would have cheered him, but the time had gone by when he found any
      pleasure in her society. There was a feeling of almost repulsion which he
      tried to conceal, and he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that the
      presence of his wife gave him rather uneasiness than comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl is very well off where he is,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;He is filling
      a business position, humble, perhaps, but still one that gives him his
      living and keeps him out of mischief. Let well enough alone, doctor, and
      don&rsquo;t interrupt his plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I may be foolish,&rdquo; said the doctor, hesitating, &ldquo;but I have not
      been feeling as well as usual lately, and if anything should happen to me
      while Carl was absent I should die very unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford regarded her husband with uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you think you are in any danger?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I am not an old man, but, on the other hand, I am an
      invalid. My father died when he was only a year older than I am at
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford drew out her handkerchief, and proceeded to wipe her
      tearless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You distress me beyond measure by your words, my dear husband. How can I
      think of your death without emotion? What should I do without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you must expect to survive me. You are younger than I, and much
      stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; and Mrs. Crawford made an artful pause, &ldquo;I hardly like to
      mention it, but Peter and I are poor, and by your death might be left to
      the cold mercies of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I would not fail to provide for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of your kind intentions, my husband,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they will
      not avail unless you provide for me in your will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s only right that I should do so. As soon as I feel equal to the
      effort I will draw up a will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will, for I should not care to be dependent on Carl, who does
      not like me. I hope you will not think me mercenary, but to Peter and
      myself this is of vital importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t misjudge you. I ought to have thought of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much about myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, in a tone of
      self-sacrifice, &ldquo;but I should not like to have Peter thrown upon the world
      without means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you say is wise and reasonable,&rdquo; answered her husband, wearily.
      &ldquo;I will attend to the matter to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mrs. Crawford came into her husband&rsquo;s presence with a sheet
      of legal cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear husband,&rdquo; she said, in a soft, insinuating tone, &ldquo;I wished to
      spare you trouble, and I have accordingly drawn up a will to submit to
      you, and receive your signature, if you approve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you learn to write a will?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used in my days of poverty to copy documents for a lawyer,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;In this way I became something of a lawyer myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Will you read what you have prepared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford read the document in her hand. It provided in the proper
      legal phraseology for an equal division of the testator&rsquo;s estate between
      the widow and Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, of course, what provision you intended to make for me,&rdquo;
       she said, meekly. &ldquo;Perhaps you do not care to leave me half the estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that seems only fair. You do not mention Peter. I ought to do
      something for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kindness touches me, my dear husband, but I shall be able to provide
      for him out of my liberal bequest. I do not wish to rob your son, Carl. I
      admit that I do not like him, but that shall not hinder me from being
      just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford was pleased with this unexpected concession from his wife. He
      felt that he should be more at ease if Carl&rsquo;s future was assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully. &ldquo;I approve of the will as you
      have drawn it up, and I will affix my signature at once.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, shall I
      send for two of the neighbors to witness it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two near neighbors were sent for and witnessed Dr. Crawford&rsquo;s signature to
      the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strangely triumphant look in Mrs. Crawford&rsquo;s eyes as she took
      the document after it had been duly executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will let me keep this, doctor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It will be important for
      your son as well as myself, that it should be in safe hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall be glad to have you do so. I rejoice that it is off my
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think me mercenary, my dear husband, or indifferent to your
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford took the will, and carrying it upstairs, opened her trunk,
      removed the false bottom, and deposited under it the last will and
      testament of Dr. Paul Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I am secure, and have compassed what I
      have labored for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford had not noticed that the will to which he affixed his
      signature was not the same that had been read to him. Mrs. Crawford had
      artfully substituted another paper of quite different tenor. By the will
      actually executed, the entire estate was left to Mrs. Crawford, who was
      left guardian of her son and Carl, and authorized to make such provision
      for each as she might deem suitable. This, of course, made Carl entirely
      dependent on a woman who hated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dr. Paul Crawford,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford to herself, with a cold
      smile, &ldquo;you may die as soon as you please. Peter and I are provided for.
      Your father died when a year older than you are now, you tell me. It is
      hardly likely that you will live to a greater age than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called the next day on the family physician, and with apparent
      solicitude asked his opinion of Dr. Crawford&rsquo;s health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is all I have,&rdquo; she said, pathetically, &ldquo;all except my dear Peter.
      Tell me what you think of his chances of continued life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband,&rdquo; replied the physician, &ldquo;has one weak organ. It is his
      heart. He may live for fifteen or twenty years, but a sudden excitement
      might carry him off in a moment. The best thing you can do for him is to
      keep him tranquil and free from any sudden shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;since so much depends on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she returned home it was with a settled purpose in her heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PETER LETS OUT A SECRET.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you direct me to the house of Dr. Crawford?&rdquo; asked a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry was addressed to Peter Cook in front of the hotel in Edgewood
      Center.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; he is my stepfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I did not know that my old friend was married again. You say you
      are his stepson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has an own son, about your age, I should judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Carl! he is a little older than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Peter, pursing up his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he absent at boarding school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s left home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated the stranger, in surprise. &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was awfully hard to get along with, and didn&rsquo;t treat mother with any
      respect. He wanted to have his own way, and, of course, ma couldn&rsquo;t stand
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; returned the stranger, and he eyed Peter curiously. &ldquo;What did his
      father say to his leaving home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he always does as ma wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Carl willing to leave home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he said he would rather go than obey ma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he receives an allowance from his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he wanted one, but ma put her foot down and said he shouldn&rsquo;t have
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother seems to be a woman of considerable firmness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet, she&rsquo;s firm. She don&rsquo;t allow no boy to boss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, this boy is a curiosity,&rdquo; said Reuben Ashcroft to himself. &ldquo;He
      doesn&rsquo;t excel in the amiable and attractive qualities. He has a sort of
      brutal frankness which can&rsquo;t keep a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you and Carl get along together?&rdquo; he asked, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get along at all. He wanted to boss me, and ma and I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the upshot was that he had to leave the house and you remained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; said Peter, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Carl was actually sent out to earn his own living without help of any
      kind from his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; asked Ashcroft, in some excitement. &ldquo;Good heavens! he
      may have suffered from hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a friend of his?&rdquo; asked Peter, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a friend of anyone who requires a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl is getting along well enough. He is at work in some factory in
      Milford, and gets a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he been back since he first left home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;bout a year,&rdquo; answered Peter, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Dr. Crawford? Is he in good health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t very well. Ma told me the other day she didn&rsquo;t think he would
      live long. She got him to make a will the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this seems to be a conspiracy!&rdquo; thought Ashcroft. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give
      something to see that will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he will provide for you and your mother handsomely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; ma said she was to have control of the property. I guess Carl will
      have to stand round if he expects any favors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident this boy can&rsquo;t keep a secret,&rdquo; thought Ashcroft. &ldquo;All the
      better for me. I hope I am in time to defeat this woman&rsquo;s schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the house,&rdquo; said Peter, pointing it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Dr. Crawford is at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he doesn&rsquo;t go out much. Ma is away this afternoon. She&rsquo;s at the
      sewing circle, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for serving as my guide,&rdquo; said Ashcroft. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little
      acknowledgment which I hope will be of service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered a half dollar to Peter, who accepted it joyfully and was
      profuse in his thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you will be kind enough to tell the doctor that an old friend
      wishes to see him, I shall be still further obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just follow me, then,&rdquo; said Peter, and he led the way into the
      sitting-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Dr. CRAWFORD IS TAKEN TO TASK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the first greetings, Reuben Ashcroft noticed with pain the fragile
      look of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo; he asked
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very strong,&rdquo; said Dr. Crawford, smiling faintly, &ldquo;but Mrs.
      Crawford takes good care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Carl, too&mdash;he is no doubt a comfort to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford flushed painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl has been away from home for a year, he said, with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange your own son, too! Is there anything unpleasant? You may
      confide in me, as I am the cousin of Carl&rsquo;s mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Carl and Mrs. Crawford didn&rsquo;t hit it off very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you took sides against your own son, said Ashcroft, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think I was wrong, Reuben. You don&rsquo;t know how I have missed
      the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you sent him out into the world without a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked Dr. Crawford quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a little conversation with your stepson as I came to the house. He
      spoke very frankly and unreservedly about family affairs; He says you do
      whatever his mother tells you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford looked annoyed and blushed with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he said his mother would not allow you to help Carl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;misunderstood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul, I fear he understands the case only too well. I don&rsquo;t want to pain
      you, but your wife is counting on your speedy death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her I didn&rsquo;t think I should live long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she got you to make a will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; did Peter tell you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said his mother was to have control of the property, and Carl would
      get nothing if he didn&rsquo;t act so as to please her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some mistake here. By my will&mdash;made yesterday&mdash;Carl is
      to have an equal share, and nothing is said about his being dependent on
      anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who drew up the will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashcroft looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to read the will myself,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;Where is
      it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford has charge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben Ashcroft remained silent, but his mind was busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman is a genius of craft,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;My poor friend is
      but a child in her hands. I did not know Paul would be so pitiably weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to be here in Edgewood, Reuben?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a little errand in the next town, and could not resist the
      temptation of visiting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay a day or two, can you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, though I had not expected to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford is away this afternoon. She will be back presently, and
      then I will introduce you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Crawford returned, and her husband introduced her to
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashcroft fixed his eyes upon her searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her face looks strangely familiar,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Where can I have
      seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford, like all persons who have a secret to conceal, was
      distrustful of strangers. She took an instant dislike to Reuben Ashcroft,
      and her greeting was exceedingly cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have invited Mr. Ashcroft to make me a visit of two or three days, my
      dear,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;He is a cousin to Carl&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford made no response, but kept her eyes fixed upon the carpet.
      She could not have shown more plainly that the invitation was not approved
      by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam does not want me here,&rdquo; thought Ashcroft, as he fixed his gaze once
      more upon his friend&rsquo;s wife. Again the face looked familiar, but he could
      not place it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not seen you before, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember you,&rdquo; she answered, slowly. &ldquo;Probably I resemble some
      one you have met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; answered Ashcroft, but he could not get rid of the
      conviction that somewhere and some time in the past he had met Mrs.
      Crawford, and under circumstances that had fixed her countenance in his
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Dr. Crawford said: &ldquo;My dear, I have told our guest that I
      had, as a prudential measure, made my will. I wish you would get it, and
      let me read it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford looked startled and annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you tell him the provisions of it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I should like to show him the document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and went upstairs. She was absent at least ten minutes. When
      she returned she was empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say,&rdquo; she remarked, with a forced laugh, &ldquo;that I have laid
      away the will so carefully that I can&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashcroft fixed a searching look upon her, that evidently annoyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be able to find it to-morrow,&rdquo; she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you told me, Paul,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, turning to Dr. Crawford, &ldquo;that
      by the will your estate is divided equally between Carl and Mrs.
      Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing is said of any guardianship on the part of Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think it would be better, Ashcroft, that you should be Carl&rsquo;s
      guardian. A man can study his interests and control him better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept the trust,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, &ldquo;though I hope it may be many
      years before the necessity arises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford bit her lips, and darted an angry glance at the two friends.
      She foresaw that her plans were threatened with failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men chatted throughout the evening, and Dr. Crawford had never of
      late seemed happier. It gave him new life and raised his spirits to chat
      over old times with his early friend.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MAN OF ENERGY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning Ashcroft said to his host: &ldquo;Paul, let us take a walk to
      the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford put on his hat, and went out with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Paul,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, when they were some rods distant from the
      house, &ldquo;is there a lawyer in Edgewood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he indite your will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mrs. Crawford wrote it out. She was at one time copyist for a
      lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice and have another drawn up to-day without mentioning the
      matter to her. She admits having mislaid the one made yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it is a prudent precaution. Then you will be sure that all is
      safe. I have, myself, executed a duplicate will. One I keep, the other I
      have deposited with my lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashcroft was a man of energy. He saw that Dr. Crawford, who was of a weak,
      vacillating temper, executed the will. He and another witnessed it, and
      the document was left with the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I had better not mention the matter to Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means&mdash;she might think it was a reflection upon her for
      carelessly mislaying the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; and the doctor, who was fond of peace, consented to his friend&rsquo;s
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked Ashcroft, &ldquo;who was your wife what was her name, I mean&mdash;before
      her second marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a Mrs. Cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, and his face lighted up with surprise and
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Crawford. &ldquo;I thought your wife&rsquo;s face was
      familiar. I met her once when she was Mrs. Cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew her, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never exchanged a word with her till I met her under this roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell him that I first saw her when a visitor to the
      penitentiary among the female prisoners?&rdquo; Ashcroft asked himself. &ldquo;My poor
      friend would sink with mortification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in friendly chat after their return from their walk,
      when Mrs. Crawford burst into the room in evident excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husband,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Peter has brought home a terrible report. He has
      heard from a person who has just come from Milford that Carl has been run
      over on the railroad and instantly killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Crawford turned pale, his features worked convulsively, and he put his
      hand to his heart, as he sank back in his chair, his face as pale as the
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; said Ashcroft, sternly, &ldquo;I believe you have killed your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! How could I be so imprudent?&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford,
      clasping her hands, and counterfeiting distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashcroft set himself at once to save his friend from the result of the
      shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; he said, sternly, to Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? I am his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have sought to be his murderer. You know that he has heart disease.
      Mrs.&mdash;Cook, I know more about you than you suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford&rsquo;s color receded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she said. She had scarcely reached the door,
      when there was a sound of footsteps outside and Carl dashed into the room,
      nearly upsetting his stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; she said, frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with my father?&rdquo; asked Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Carl?&rdquo; said Ashcroft, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has had a shock. I think I can soon bring him to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Dr. Crawford opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you feeling better, Paul?&rdquo; asked Ashcroft, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear something about Carl&mdash;something terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carl is alive and well,&rdquo; said he, soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked Dr. Crawford, in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have the best evidence of it. Here is Carl himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl came forward and was clasped in his father&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven, you are alive,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not be?&rdquo; asked Carl, bewildered, turning to Ashcroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your stepmother had the&mdash;let me say imprudence, to tell your father
      that you had been killed on the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could she have heard such a report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that she heard it at all,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, in a low voice.
      &ldquo;She knew that your father had heart disease.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Crawford re-entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; she demanded, coolly, of Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here because this is my father&rsquo;s house, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have behaved badly to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;You have defied my
      authority, and brought sorrow and distress to your good father. I thought
      you would have the good sense to stay away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you indorse this, father?&rdquo; asked Carl, turning to Dr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered his father, with unwonted energy. &ldquo;My house will always be
      your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have changed your mind, Dr. Crawford,&rdquo; sneered his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you pick up the report of Carl&rsquo;s being killed on the railroad?&rdquo;
       asked the doctor, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter heard it in the village,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it occur to you that the sudden news might injure your husband?&rdquo;
       asked Ashcroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke too impulsively. I realize too late my imprudence,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Crawford, coolly. &ldquo;Have you lost your place?&rdquo; she asked, addressing Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have just returned from Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His stepmother looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a quiet time since you left us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you value your
      father&rsquo;s health and peace of mind, you will not remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my presence also unwelcome?&rdquo; asked Ashcroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not treated me with respect,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;If you are
      a gentleman, you will understand that under the circumstances it will be
      wise for you to take your departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving my old friend to your care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will be best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ashcroft, can I have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you?&rdquo; asked
      Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the room together, followed by an uneasy and suspicious glance
      from Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl hurriedly communicated to his father&rsquo;s friend what he had learned
      about his stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cook, Peter&rsquo;s father, is just outside,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I call him
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had better do so, but arrange that the interview shall take
      place without your father&rsquo;s knowledge. He must not be excited. Call him
      in, and then summon your stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Carl, re-entering his father&rsquo;s room, &ldquo;Mr. Ashcroft
      would like to have a few words with you. Can you come out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed Carl uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want with me, sir?&rdquo; she asked, frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me introduce an old acquaintance of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cook, whom Mrs. Crawford had not at first observed, came forward. She
      drew back in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is some time since we met, Lucy,&rdquo; said Cook, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you come here to make trouble?&rdquo; she muttered, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to ask for the property you took during my absence in California,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to have you return to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obtained a divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; I don&rsquo;t care to annul it. I am thankful that you are no longer
      my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I will see what I can do for you. Don&rsquo;t go near my present
      husband. He is in poor health, and cannot bear a shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Ashcroft, gravely, &ldquo;if you have any idea of
      remaining here, in this house, give it up. I shall see that your husband&rsquo;s
      eyes are opened to your real character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you heard this man say that he has no claim upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, but I cannot permit my friend to harbor a woman whose record
      is as bad as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she demanded, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you have served a term in prison for larceny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; she said, with trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. I visited the prison during your term of confinement, and saw
      you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, can certify to it,&rdquo; said Cook. &ldquo;I learned it two years after my
      marriage. You will understand why I am glad of the divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was silent for a moment. She realized that the battle was
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, after a pause, &ldquo;I am defeated. I thought my secret was
      safe, but I was mistaken. What do you propose to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you this evening,&rdquo; said Ashcroft. &ldquo;One thing I can say now&mdash;you
      must not expect to remain in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I no longer care to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A conference was held during the afternoon, Dr Crawford being told as much
      as was essential. It was arranged that Mrs. Crawford should have an
      allowance of four hundred dollars for herself and Peter if she would leave
      the house quietly, and never again annoy her husband. Mr. Cook offered to
      take Peter, but the latter preferred to remain with his mother. A private
      arrangement was made by which Dr. Crawford made up to Mr. Cook one-half of
      the sum stolen from him by his wife, and through the influence of
      Ashcroft, employment was found for him. He is no longer a tramp, but a man
      held in respect, and moderately prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl is still in the employ of Mr. Jennings, and his father has removed to
      Milford, where he and his son can live together. Next September, on his
      twenty-first birthday, Carl will be admitted to a junior partnership in
      the business, his father furnishing the necessary capital. Carl&rsquo;s
      stepmother is in Chicago, and her allowance is paid to her quarterly
      through a Chicago bank. She has considerable trouble with Peter, who has
      become less submissive as he grows older, and is unwilling to settle down
      to steady work. His prospects do not look very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jennings and Hannah are as much attached as ever to Carl, and it is
      quite likely the manufacturer will make him his heir. Happy in the society
      of his son, Dr. Crawford is likely to live to a good old age, in spite of
      his weakness and tendency to heart disease, for happiness is a great aid
      to longevity.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
